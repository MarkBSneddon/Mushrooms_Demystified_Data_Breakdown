# Mushrooms Demystified Data Breakdown

This project aims to convert the book "Mushrooms Demystified" by David Arora into a usable dataset using the ChatGPT API. By leveraging the power of the ChatGPT language model, we can extract information from the book and create a structured dataset that can be used for various applications such as mushroom identification, research, or educational purposes.

## Introduction

"Mushrooms Demystified" is a comprehensive guidebook on mushrooms, covering a vast array of species and providing detailed descriptions, photographs, and other valuable information. However, accessing and utilizing this information in a structured manner can be challenging.

This project utilizes the ChatGPT API, which is an AI language model developed by OpenAI, to convert the book into a usable dataset. The ChatGPT API allows us to interact with the model programmatically and extract specific information from the text, such as mushroom names, descriptions, characteristics, and more.

## Usage

The resulting dataset can be used in various ways, including:

- Mushroom species identification
- Research and analysis of mushroom characteristics
- Educational materials for learning about mushrooms
- Integration into mushroom-related applications or platforms

## Requirements

To use this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.6 or later
- OpenAI Python library (`openai`)

Make sure you have access to the ChatGPT API. If not, refer to the [API Access](#api-access) section for instructions on how to obtain it.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MarkBSneddon/Mushrooms_Demystified_Data_Breakdown.git
```

2. Navigate to the project direcotry:
