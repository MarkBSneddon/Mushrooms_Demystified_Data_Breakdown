Common_Name: Scaly Chanterelle; Woolly Chanterelle
Group?: Yes
FRUITING_BODY nearly cylindrical, soon becoming more or less trumpet-or vase-shaped, 5-20 cm high. CAP 3-15 cm broad, depressed and soon hollow in the center; surface reddish to bright orange, buffy-, oryellow-orange(but often fading! ), with large cottony or woolly scales, the ones at the center often recurved in age; margin often wavy or lobed. Flesh rather fibrous, whitish; taste mild to sour. UNDERSIDE (fertile surface) milky white to creamy, buff, dingy yellowish, or pale ochre; with blunt, shallow, frequently forking, deeply decurrent veins or ridges, sometimes with a somewhat poroid appearance in age. STALK 3-10 cm long, 1-3 cm thick, continuous with cap, central or off-center, tapering downward, solid becoming hollow in age, white to orange or yellowish. SPORE_PRINT ochraceous; spores 10-16 x 5-8 microns, elliptical, slightly wrinkled or warted. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious or sometimes clustered on ground under conifers; widely distributed in northern and montane North America. Along with G. bonari (see comments), it is common in northern California and the Sierra Nevada in the summer, fall, and even spring, but like G. clavatus, it does not seem to occur on the coast south of San Francisco. It is also common in the Southwest, Pacific Northwest, and Rockies. EDIBILITY Not recommended. Some people pronounce it delicious, but others are adversely affected by it (they suffer gastric upsets) and the specimens I've sampled had an unpleasant sour taste. Its only asset is its distinctiveness-it would be very difficult to confuse it with anything other than its close relatives (see comments). "

CAP 4-15 cm broad, plane to broadly depressed with an often wavy or irregularly lobed margin; surface smooth or breaking up into small scales in age, moist to dry but not viscid; dull white or whitish, bruising yellowish-orange to orange-brown. Flesh thick, firm, white; odor mild or faintly fragrant. UNDERSIDE (fertile surface) with thick, well-spaced, shallow, blunt, deeply decurrent, foldlike gills which are usually forked orveined between; dull white or pinkish-tinged, often staining yellowish to orange in age or where bruised. STALK2-7 cm long, 1-5 cm thick, equal or tapered downward, central oroff-center, solid, firm, smooth, dull whitish, discoloring yellowish-orange to orange-brown in age or where bruised. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 7-9 x 5-5.5 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious on ground in woods; known only from the Pacific Northwest and California. It is quite abundant under second-growth conifers in the late summer, fall, and winter in Washington, oregon, and northern California, and I have also seen large fruitings in Idaho. In our area it fruits in the fall and early winter, but is only occasionally common. The best places to look for it are on the high, exposed ridges of our coastal mountains under tanoak and madrone or in manzanita thickets mixed with knobcone pine. It often grows with Armillaria ponderosa, another choice edible. EDIBILITY Edible and choice-as good as C. cibarius or even better, and like that species, rarely attacked by maggots. In the Pacific Northwest the buttons are firm, meaty, and very compact-ideal for marinating or prolonged refrigeration. Unfortunately, it is not nearly so common in our area and the fruiting bodies, when found, are often water-logged and overripe. "

CAP (2) 3-15 (25) cm broad, broadly convex when young, becoming plane to depressed or vase-shaped in age; surface smooth or occasionally cracked, not viscid; orange to bright golden-orange, egg-yellow, or yellow (but in dry weather or direct sunlight often bleached out and cracked or even greenish from algae); margin usually lobed or wavy, at first incurved. Flesh thick, firm, whitish or tinged yellow to orange under the cuticle; odor mild or faintly fruity (like pumpkins or apricots); taste mild to somewhat peppery or occasionally bitter. UNDERSIDE (fertile surface) with thick, well-spaced to close, shallow (narrow), blunt, foldlike, deeply decurrent gills which are often forked or cross-veined; colored like cap or more often paler (but brighter if cap has faded); not fading, but sometimes developing dingy orange-brown stains in old age.

SPORE_PRINT creamy or yellow in most forms, but pinkish in one variety; spores 7-11 x 4-6 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious on ground in woods, occurring throughout the north temperate zone and very common on the west coast in the fall, winter, and spring. In northern California and the Pacific Northwest it grows mainly with conifers, but in our area it favors live oaks, especially those at the edges of pastures. It hasa long growing season and is ajoy to find-brilliant splashes of gold against the subdued backdrop of decaying leaves. If you see one, probe around and you'll probably uncover more-they often hide under the humus. If rainfall is sufficient, successive crops are prod uced over a long period of time, so check your patches regularly (but don't check mine!). EDIBILITY Edible and choice-the best known wild mushroom in California, if not in North America. It is so plentiful and popular on the west coast that it is now being harvested commercially and shipped abroad or sold to restaurants and markets. A few tips for the uninitiated: Chanterelles should always be cooked as they are somewhat fibrous raw. Pick selectively-firm specimens will keep in the refrigerator for a week, whereas waterlogged individuals will rot rapidly and cook up slimy. Even firm ones have a high water content and should be sauteed slowly and thoroughly in an open pan. You waste them if you can't taste them, so don't just mix them in with a bunch of other vegetables. They are best in simple dishes that highlight their delica te fla vor and fruity fragrance-cream of chanterelle soup is a traditional favorite. on the west coast chanterelles are virtually free of maggots, an asset keenly appreciated by those who hunt them-but they're often full of dirt, a quality deeply detested by those who have to clean them! (If your ""chanterelles"" are pristine and wormy, they may not be chanterelles!). Curiously, it's just the opposite in the eastern United States, where they are usually quite spotless, but often lunched on by maggots! Imported chanterelles can be purchased in small tins at delicatessens-for an outrageous price, of course. They are low in protein but high in vitamin A. Attempts to cultivate them commercially have not been successfuL "

It is common in our area in the winter and spring under hardwoods(live oak, tanoak, man-zanita, madrone, huckleberry), but farther north it fruits in the late fall under conifers. South of San Francisco it rarely appears before Christmas, usually peaks at the same time that the fetid adder's tongue blooms,andmayfruitonintoApril. IneasternNorthAmerica it is largely replaced by C.fallax (see comments), which also occurs in our area. Though terrestrial, it often fruits near fallen branches or at the bases of trees or manzanita burls. EDIBILITY one of my fifteen ""five favorite flavorful fleshy fungalfructifications."" Like myself, it is thin, tough, and dark, and like myself, it goes largely unappreciated. It is forever being passed up in favor of the larger, fleshier, more colorful and impressive types, yet its flavor is superb and its potential unlimited. It is partly to blame for this sad state of affairs, for its appearance is admittedly drab and rather somber, and it shuns attention, blending unobtrusively into the dark, secretive situations where it thrives. But though it takes an accomplished eye to detect its presence in the woods (from the top it looks like a hole in the ground), anyone can detect its presence in a dish-for it cooks up black, announcing itself with unmistakable earthy authenticity. It can play any culinary position with equal finesse, from first base to second fiddle, enhancing practically any dish, be it soup, souffle, or sauce. Like its more popular cousin the chanterelle, it is not often inhabited by maggots. Dried and powdered it has a cheesy odor and is known, quite appropriately, as ..Poor People's Truffle."" "

Outer layer of peridium(skin) thick when young (24 mm), at first smooth (with texture of kid glove) and pure white or brownish-stained (but in the California version often breaking up into brownish scales even when young), then cracking up into flat scales or plates which eventually flake off to expose the thin olive-brown inner layer-which soon disintegrates-or both layers falling off together. STERILE_BASE absent or rudimentary, but a cord-like ""root"" often present. SPORE_MASS at first white and firm or cheesy, becoming greenish-yellow and mushy with an unpleasant odor (like old urine), finally deep olive-brown to brown and powdery. Spores 3.5-6 microns, round or nearly round, smooth or minutely spiny, apiculate. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups or large circles in fields, pastures, open woods, cemeteries, on exposed hillsides, along roads, in drainage ditches, etc.; fairly common in eastern North America and the Midwest. The west coast form, which is slightly different (see comments), is sometimes abundant in our area after the first fall rains and again in the spring. In fact, when conditions are favorable it is not unusual to find 30-40 pounds on a casual jaunt through a ""puffball pasture."" Because of its preference for open hillsides, it can often be spotted from the road, Large specimens, in fact, have been mis-taken by passersby for herds of grazing sheep! (Mushroom hunters, on the other hand, are more likely to mistake grazing sheep for giant puffballs.) Dried specimens found under houses have been mistaken for bleached skulls, while a sinister-looking individual found in England during the war was labelled ""Hitler's Secret Weapon"" and used for propaganda purposes at an exhibition to raise war funds! EDIBILITY Edible and choice when the flesh is firm and white, but with laxative effects on certain individuals. It can be sliced and fried like pancakes, or better yet, cubed like tofu and dropped into clear soups or eaten raw in salads. The tough outer skin should be peeled and those which have begun to ripen should be discarded. Size it not necessarily an indication of maturity, so slice them open in the field. This will enable you to check for maggots, which are fanatically fond of them. Infested areas can be trimmed away and the solid portions carried home. Dried giant puffballs have been used as sponges, tinder (before matches were invented), toys, and dyes. They were burned under beehives to stupefy bees and used to squelch bleeding. "

Outer layer of peridium (skin) smooth at first, but soon cracking into small, flat scales or patches, at least on top; white to tan or pinkish-tan becoming purplish or purple-brown in age; inner layer dark purple or purple-brown, smooth, thin and delicate; both layers flaking off in old age. STERILE_BASE usually present (but see comments), chambered, white to dingy yellow or darker, persisting as a deep purplish to purple-brown cuplike structure after the spores have dispersed. SPORE_MASS firm and white when young, becoming yellowish, then brownish and finally dull purple and powdery. Spores 3.5-7.5 microns, round, spiny or warty to nearly smooth. HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious or in rings in pastures and other grassy places, widely distributed. It is common locally in the fall, occasional at other times. EDIBILITY Edible and quite good when firm and white inside. It is not quite as tasty as the giant puffball, but is not as rich either. "
"Genus: Calvatia
Species: lycoperdoides
Common_Name: Cotton-Spored Puffball
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 1.5-5 cm high and broad, more or less round to somewhat cushion-shaped. Outer layer of peridium (skin) white or pallid becoming brownish in age, at first with soft granules, flakes, or spines (or often with small warts on top); adhering to the inner layer and breaking up into large flakes at maturity. STERILE_BASE absent or rudimentary. SPORE_MASS firm and white when young, olive-brown to brown at maturity, with a cottony texture that causes it to remain intact for a long time. Spores 4-6.5 microns, round, with small warts. HABITAT Solitary or in small groups on ground in woods and under trees; known only from western North America, but C. craniiformis(see comments) is common in the eastern states. It can be found in our area in the late fall, winter, and spring, but is not common. EDIBILITY Presumably edible when immature, but not big or plentiful enough to warrant collecting. I haven't tried it. "

Species: subcretacea
Common_Name: Small Warted Mountain Puffball
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY golfball-to baseball-sized, 1.5-5 (7) cm in diameter, round or more often cushion-shaped to somewhat flattened. Peridium (skin) thick and white when fresh, the outer layer composed of white to smoky-gray or grayish-tipped warts which break up into plates or polygons and then flake off, exposing the yellowish to brownish inner layer, which breaks up irregularly.

"Genus: Mycenastrum
Species: corium
Common_Name: N/A
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 4-20 cm broad or more, round to somewhat pear-shaped when young, eventually rupturing in irregular fissures to form rays or plates which may bend back somewhat in a star-shaped pattern. Outer layer of peridium (skin) a thick, white, felty coat which becomes areolate(separates into blocklike areas), forming thin, grayish, fibrillose patches which eventually wear away to expose the tough, hard, persistent, smooth inner layer, which is brown to purple-brown and about 2 mm thick.

Spores 8-12 microns, round, warted-reticulate. Capillitium branched, thorny. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious on ground (sometimes partially buried) in horse corrals, composted areas, and fields where livestock have been grazing; widely distributed, but especially common in the West. In our area it occurs year-round. The tough spore cases persist for months, sometimes breaking loose to blow about in the wind. EDIBILITY Presumably edible when firm and white inside; I haven't tried it. "
"Genus: Lycoperdon
Species: pyriforme
Common_Name: Pear-Shaped Puffball
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY pear-shaped to nearly round, but usually with a stemlike sterile base; 1.5-5 cm high and sometimes almost as broad in the widest part. Peridium (skin) whitish to pale brown when young, yellowish to dark rusty-brown in age; at first smooth or with a few small scattered spines on top, then becoming finely cracked to form small patches or minute granules or particles (making it rough to the touch), this rough outer layer slowly but eventually falling away to expose the smooth inner layer in which an apical pore or tear is very slow to form. STERILE_BASE small or well-developed, spongy when fresh, occupying the stemlike base (if base is present); chambers very small; conspicuous white mycelial threads (rhizomorphs) usually radiating from the base and connected to others in the surrounding wood or humus. SPORE_MASS at first firm and white, then yellow to olive and finally deep olive-brown and powdery. Spores 3-4.5 microns, round, smooth. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious or clustered on stumps, rotting logs, sawdust, and in lignin-rich humus; widely distributed and common, fruiting mostly in the fall and winter in our area, but old bleached-out fruiting bodies can be found most any time. It sometimes forms dense clusters ""as large as a loaf of bread"" (to borrow a phrase from Alexander Smith). EDIBILITY Edible when young, but only worth collecting when it occurs in quantity. In my fickle fungal opinion it is one of the better puffballs, but is not as good as ""a loaf of bread"" and is apt to be bitter if not absolutely white and firm inside. "

FRUITING_BODY pear-shaped to nearly round, but usually with a narrowed base; 1.5-6 cm high and 1.5-4 cm broad. Outer layer of peridium (skin) composed of fine pointed black to dark brown spines (especially dense on top) interspersed with granular material, the spines persisting or eventually falling away; background (inner layer) thin, grayish-tan to yellowish (usually distinctly yellow in age), developing an apical pore or tear at maturity. STERILE_BASE well-developed, chambered and spongy when fresh; exterior usually paler than the rest of fruiting body, at least when young. SPORE_MASS white when young, then yellow, finally dull cinnamon-brown to dark brown or sepia, and pow-dery. Spores 4-5 microns, round, minutely spiny. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups in humus and debris in deep woods along the west coast (also Europe). Fairly common in our area from fall through early spring-especially under conifers-but easily overlooked because of its dark color. EDIBILITY Presumably edible when firm and white inside; I haven't tried it. "

Common_Name: Common Puffball; Gemmed Puffball
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY pear-shaped or top-shaped (broader above) or with a flattened lop, or at times practically round with a narrowed, often wrinkled stemlike base; 1.5-6 (9) cm broad, 3-7 (10) cm high. Outer layer of peridium (skin) consisting of slender, short, cone-shaped spines interspersed with smaller spines or granules, the larger ones leaving scars or pockmarks when they fall off; spines white to gray or in one form brown. Inner layer at first with scars, but often smooth in old age, white to tan becoming yellowish-brown to grayish-brown or dark brown in old age; eventually rupturing through a pore at the top. STERILE_BASE large, well-developed, chambered, forming a stalklike base beneath the spore mass; at first white and spongy, then yellow, olive, brown, or chocolate-colored. SPORE_MASS firm and white but soon becoming soft and turning yellow, then olive, and finally becoming dark olive-brown to chocolate-brown or brown and powdery. Spores 3.5-4.5 microns, round, minutely spiny. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, gregarious, or clustered on ground in woods and under trees, along roads, or sometimes in the open; very widely distributed. It is probably the most abundant woodland puffball in North America, and our region is no exception. It can be found most any time in our area, but usually fruits in the fall or winter. EDIBILITY Edible when firm and white inside, but specimens showing the slightest traces of yellow should not be eaten. It occasionally occurs in enough quantity to merit collecting, but in my experience it is bland at best and bitter at worst. "
"Genus: Lycoperdon

FRUITING_BODY more or less pear-shaped or rounded above with a narrowed, stem-like, often wrinkled base; 2-5 cm broad and high. Outer layer of peridium (skin) with a dense coating of long (3-6 mm), slender, white spines which typically form numerous fascicles (by uniting at their tips); spines eventually wearing away to expose the smooth brown to dark purple-brown inner layer; pore forming at the top in age. STERILE_BASE occupying up to one half the height of fruiting body, chambered, white when young, brown to purple-brown in age. SPORE_MASS white and firm at first, becoming yellow and eventually dark purple-brown and powdery. Spores 4-4.5 microns, round, minutely spiny, with a long pedicel (""tail"") 10-13 microns in length. HABITAT Solitary or in small groups in humus or on very rotten wood, usually under hardwoods. It is not uncommon in eastern North America (especially the southern states), and I occasionally find it (or something very similar) in our area in the fall and early winter. EDIBILITY Edible when young, but too small and infrequent to be of value. "

FRUITING_BODY at first round to somewhat flattened, at maturity often broader than it is tall, the underside usually wrinkled (at least in age) and sometimes with a short, rooting base; 1-5 cm in diameter. Peridium (skin) white or tinged pinkish when young, the outer layer composed of short erect warts or spines which peel off in sheets, exposing the smooth to slightly scurfy or faintly pitted, pale to dark olive-brown inner layer; an apical pore eventually forming. STERILE_BASE chambered, usually well-developed but sometimes inconspicuous. SPORE_MASS white and firm at first, then olive to grayish-brown and eventually powdery. Spores 3.5-5.5 microns, round, minutely ornamented or smooth, sometimes with a broken pedicel (""tail""). HABITAT Scattered or in groups or clusters on ground, usually in sandy soil or waste places; widely distributed. I find it regularly in sandy soil under oak, pine, madrone, and manzanita, usually in the late fall and winter. EDIBILITY Edible when firm and white inside. In Mexico, this species and L. mizte-corum are used to induce auditory hallucinations. It is known as ""gi-i-sa-wa,"" meaning ..fungus of the second quality""(L. miztecorum being the fungus offirst quality). However, no intoxicating substances were found when these puffballs were analyzed. "

Mature fruiting body 3-6 cm broad and 5-10 cm high, usually poised on the pointed tips of its rays, the tips joined to a concave mycelial mat or ""cup"" which has a grayish interior and debris-incrusted exterior and may be broken into rays itself. RAYS not hygroscopic; underside usually smooth and tan to brown; upper surface chocolate-brown to dark brown or nearly blackish, but peeling off in patches to reveal the smooth, paler brown or tan undersurface. SPORE_CASE 1-2.5 cm broad, round or somewhat flattened to urn-shaped, mounted on a pedicel (short stalk), often with a compressed collar underneath it (at the top of the pedicel); surface brown to dark chocolate brown, finely velvety; rupturing at the top to form a fairly large, irregularly torn or lacerated pore. SPORE_MASS chocolate-brown to blackish-brown and powdery at maturity. Spores 3-5 microns, round, warted. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious in humus under trees, on rubbish, around stables and other waste places, etc.; widely distributed, but apparently rare except in southern California and the Southwest, where it is quite common. In our area] have found it in only one locality-under oaks where there is run-off from a bathing area for horses-but it fruits there by the hundreds and can be found every month of the year. In New Mexico it is quite common under juniper. EDIBILITY Inedible, but makes an extraordinary ornament or conversation piece (it is easily dried). "
