"Genus: Pleurotus
Species: ostreatus
Common_Name: Oyster Mushroom
Group?: No
CAP 4-15 cm broad or more, oyster-shaped or fan-shaped, convex becoming plane or sometimes funnel-shaped; surface smooth, slightly lubricous when moist but not viscid; color variable: white to gray, grayish-brown, tan, or dark brown (sometimes yellowish in old age); margin inrolled when young, often wavy or lobed. Flesh thick, white, firm but soft, tougher near the stalk; odor and taste mild. GILLS fairly close, broad, decurrent (if stalk is present), white or tinged gray but often discoloring yellowish in old age. STALK absent or if present usually short, stout, and off-center or lateral (but sometimes central); 0.5-4 cm long and thick; solid, firm, dry, usually hairy or downy at least at base. VEIL absent. SPORE_PRINT white to pale lilac or lilac-gray; spores 7-9 x 3-4 microns, oblong to elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Occasionally solitary but usually in shelving masses or overlapping rows or columns on hardwood logs and stumps; sometimes also on standing trees, rarely on conifers; common throughout most of the northern hemisphere. Its preferred hosts include elm, cottonwood, alder, and sycamore, but in our area it favors oak and tanoak, prod ucing large crops after the first fall rains and smaller crops thereafter through the spring. I have also seen stupendous fruitings (several hundred pounds!) growing in clusters in a treeless field where crushed coffee beans were dumped. It is easily cultivated on a wide variety of substrates, including compressed sawdust, shredded Time magazines, and presumably coffee grounds. If an ""oyster log"" is dragged home from the wild and kept moist, it will produce crops regularly. EDIBILITY Edible and delicious-breaded and fried it is superb and remarkably remi-niscent of seafood. Be sure to check for small beetles between the gills (these can be re-moved by dousing the mushroom briefly in water), and of course, for maggots. The tough stem or basal stump of tissue should be removed. Large specimens can be pounded like abalone to make them tender. P. ostreatus and its Asian counterpart, P. sajor-cajou, are now cultivated commercially and sold fresh under the name ""tree oysters."" "

Flesh thick, tough, white, but often aging or bruising yellow; not decaying readily, odor usually distinctive (pungent or fragrant). GILLS usually decurrent but sometimes notched or adnate, whitish to buff or in one form yellow, often bruising brownish andlor yellowish in age; edges entire when young but often serrated in age. STALK 3-5 cm long, 1-3 cm thick, central to somewhat off-center, tapered at base; solid, tough and hard, colored more or less like cap, usually with brownish to reddish-brown scales or fibrils below ring. VEIL membranous, forming a pallid, superior to apical ring on stalk which may be slight or disappear in age. SPORE_PRINT whitish; spores 9-12 x 4-5 microns, almost cylindrical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in small groups on conifer logs, stumps, fence posts, and other lumber, sometimes also on oak; widely distributed and fairly common in cool weather in the coniferous forests of the West, but rare in our area and less frequent than L. ponderosus in the Sierra Nevada. It used to be common on railroad ties, resulting in derailments and the common name, ""train-wrecker."" It causes a brown rot in its host.

Flesh thick, tough, not readily decaying, white (but may age or bruise yellowish); odor often fragrant. GILLS typically decurrent, fairly close, white to yellowish, but often developing orangish to rusty-brown stains in age; edges serrated or torn, at least at maturity. STALK 5-20 cm long, 2-8 cm thick, central or off-center, usually with a narrowed, rooting base; solid, hard, tough, whitish aging yellowish to brown or rusty-orange, often with brownish patches or scales. VEIL absent. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 8-12 x 3-5.5 microns, elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Solitary or in groups or clusters on or near dead conifers (but often appearing terrestrial) in the late spring, summer, and early fall; known only from western North America. Although not common in ost areas, it is very conspicuous because of its large size. I have never seen it at low elevations, but it is often abundant in the Sierra Nevada in the summer on lodgepole pine. I have also collected it on ponderosa pine in the South-west. It produces a brown rot in its host. EDIBILITY Edible and choice, but thorough cooking or parboiling is required because of its toughness. Biologist Bob Winter of Fresno says that it is avidly sought by Japanese-Americans as a shiitake-and matsutake-substitute, perhaps because of its chewy texture. "

SPORE_PRINT dull pinkish to pinkish-buff; spores 5.5-8 x 3.5-5 microns, elliptical, roughened. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious, often in rings or arcs-in woods, brush, gardens, compost piles, i.e., wherever there is organic debris; widely distributed. It seems to favor cool weather but is common in our area throughout the mushroom season. A favorite abode is in brambles under live oak, often in the company of chanterelles; it is also common under pine and cypress, and I have found it on Ano Nuevo Island in beach grass and elephant seal dung. A single mycelium will produce several crops a year, so check your patches regularly. I know of one fairy ring sixty feet in diameter that produces about 200 blewits each time it fruits! Known as a ""trash inhabitor"" because of its fondness for virtually any type of decomposing organic matter, it can be grown on a wide range of substrates, including shredded newspapers and compost. EDIBILITY Edible and very popular a favorite with beginners and gourmets alike, and one of the most plentiful edible wild mushrooms in our area. It has the dubious distinction of being one of the few purple foods that actually tastes good. It is even popular in fungophobic England and Scotland, where it is sometimes sold in markets. "

STALK 5-12 cm long, 0.5-3 cm thick, equal or enlarged below, whitish, fibrillose, fibrous, often curved. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 4.5-6 x 3-3.5 microns, elliptical, smooth. Basidia lacking siderophilous granules. HABITAT In densely-packed groups or clusters in sandy or gravelly soil along roads, trails, etc.; very common in the fall in thePacific Northwest and Yukon. I have not seen it in California, but it may occur in the northern part ofthe state, and Chuck Barrows reports it from New Mexico. EDIBILITY Probably poisonous-it is thought to contain muscarine. "
"Genus: Clitocybe
Species: nebularis
Common_Name: Cloudy Clitocybe
Group?: No
CAP 6-25 cm broad or more, convex becoming plane or depressed; surface dry, finely fibrillose or often with a hoary bloom, gray to grayish-brown to buff, often darker at the center, sometimes with watery spots or appearing streaked; margin at first incurved, often wavy or lobed in age. Flesh thick, white; odor rancid and disagreeable. GILLS adnate to decurrent, close, whitish becoming dingy yellowish or buff. STALK 6-15 cm long, 1.54 cm thick, base often enlarged and covered with white down; whitish, or with dingy brownish fibrils, firm but easily broken. SPORE_PRINT pale buffto yellowish; spores 5.5-8.5 x 3.5-4.5 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious, often in large rings, under both hardwoods and conifers; widely distributed but especially common on the west coast. It is fond of cold weather and in our area seldom appears before December. EDIBILITY Edible but far from incredible. It is indigestible unless thoroughly cooked, its flavor is said to be poor, and its rank odor doesn't exactly make you want to rush home and throw it in the frying pan. "
"Genus: Clitocybe
Species: clavipes
Common_Name: Club-Foot
Group?: No
CAP 2-10 cm broad, broadly convex or plane becoming depressed or funnel-shaped; surface more or less smooth, not viscid, brownish to grayish-brown or olive-brown, often paler toward the margin. Flesh pallid, odor mild or often somewhat fragrant or fruity. GILLS decurrent, fairly close, at first white, then yellowish-buff in age. STALK 2-7 cm long, 0.5-1.2 cm thick at apex, typically club-shaped (enlarged below), pallid with grayish or sordid olive-buff fibrils; base often spongy and covered with white down. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 6-8.5 x 3-5 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious under conifers and in mixed woods, late fall and winter; widely distributed. It is particularly abundant in pine plantations in eastern North America, rather infrequent in California (although several similar species occur). I have not seen it in our area. EDIBILITY Edible, but not recommended. Not only is there the danger of confusing it with poisonous species, but it has reportedly caused coprine-like poisoning when consumed with alcohol (see p. 896). "
"Genus: Clitocybe
Species: albirhiza
Common_Name: Snowmelt Clitocybe
Group?: No
CAP 2-10 cm broad, convex becoming plane to broadly umbonate, then depressed; surface smooth or with whitish down, or sometimes with riverlike lines; watery brown to pale buff to cinnamon-buff, pinkish-buff, or grayish-buff. Flesh thin, colored like cap; odor unpleasant or mild. GILLS adnate to decurrent, close, pale buff or colored more or less like cap. STALK 3-8 cm long, 0.4-2 cm thick, equal or tapered at either end, often hollow in age, sometimes fluted; colored more or less like cap, the base with a dense mass of white mycelial threads. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 4.5-6 x 2.5-3.5 microns, elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious, often in small clusters or rings, on ground under conifers; common in the mountains of western North America, especially in the spring shortly after the snow melts (sometimes found with Lyophyllum montanum). EDIBILITY Unknown. "
"Genus: Clitocybe
Species: odora
Common_Name: Blue-Green Anise Mushroom
Group?: No
CAP 2.5-10 cm broad, convex to plane or somewhat depressed; surface smooth, not viscid, bluish-green to dingy greenish, gray, or grayish-brown with a slight blue-green tinge, to nearly whitish in dry weather. Flesh whitish or tinged cap color; odor strongly fragrant, anise-like, at least when fresh. GILLS adnate to decurrent, close, blue-green to greenish or dark green in one form, whitish to buff or pinkish-buff in another. STALK 2-6 (9) cm long, 0.5-1.5 (3) cm thick, equal or thicker at either end; smooth, white to buff or cap-colored. SPORE_PRINT pinkish-cream or buff; spores 6-8 x 3-5 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Scattered or in groups in woods; widely distributed. It favors oak in eastern North America, but in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest it is often abundant under conifers. In our area it is rare-I have seen it only twice, under oak in the winter. EDIBILITY Edible, but best used as a flavoring agent because of the strong taste. "
"Genus: Clitocybe
Species: deceptiva
Common_Name: Anise Mushroom
Group?: No
CAP 1-6 cm broad, broadly convex becoming plane or depressed; surface smooth, not viscid, color variable: pale brown to grayish-brown fading to buff or watery whitish, sometimes with a darker marginal band; margin at first incurved. Flesh thin, pallid, odor distinctly fragrant and anise-like when fresh. GILLS adnate to slightly decurrent, close, white or cap-colored or slightly darker. STALK 2-7 cm long, 1.5-5 (7) mm thick, equal or thicker at base, smooth, more or less colored like cap, usually rather slender. SPORE_PRINT pale pinkish-buff; spores 6.5-9x 4-4.5 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious in damp places under conifers; western North America. In our area this species and its close relatives(see comments) are often common in the fall, winter, and early spring under redwood and pine, or occasionally oak. EDIBILITY Edible, but best used as a flavoring agent (in cakes, breads, cookies, etc.), because of its strong, anise-like (but not sweet) flavor. Be sure each and every specimen smells like anise-there are numerous look-alikes without the anise odor, some of which grow in the same habitats and are poisonous! "
"Genus: Clitocybe
Species: dealbata
Common_Name: Sweat-Producing Clitocybe
Group?: No
CAP 1-4 (5) cm broad, convex becoming plane or depressed; surface smooth, not viscid, white to dingy white, grayish, or buff, sometimes with a pinkish tinge in wet weather, sometimes with watery spots. Flesh thin, grayish to white; odor mild. GILLS grayish-white to buff or pinkish-buff, close, adnate to decurrent. STALK 1-4 cm long, 2-7 mm thick, equal or slightly thicker at either end, colored like cap, smooth, rather tough. SPORE_PRINT white or rarely creamy; spores 4-5.5 x 2-4 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious or in rings, in pastures and other grassy places; widely distributed and common locally in the fall and winter. In the Pacific Northwest it fre-quently mixes company with Marasmius oreades, but in our area is more often found with Agaricus campeslris and A. cupreobrunneus. EDIBILITY Poisonous-and potentially fatal to small children in the ""grazing"" stage! It produces profuse sweating, salivation, diarrhea, etc. Muscarine is the main toxin (see p. 894 for details). "

SPORE_PRINT white; spores 4.5-6.5 x 3.5-4.5 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, smooth or very minutely ornamented, amyloid. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups on burnt soil and debris, especially under conifers; widely distributed and fairly common in our area in the appropriate habitat, fall through spring. I often find it with Pholiota brunnescens and Psathyrella carbonicola. EDIBILITY Unknown, but too puny to be of value. "
"Genus: Leucopaxillus
Species: albissimus
Common_Name: Large White Leucopaxillus
Group?: No
CAP 5-20 (40) cm broad or more, convex with an inrolled margin when young, becoming plane or depressed in age; surface dry, dull, unpolished. white becoming buff, yellowish, or even tan (at least toward center) in age, often cracked or splitting in age or dry weather; margin sometimes obscurely ribbed. Flesh thick, tough, white; odor unpleasant or fragrant, taste also variable (mild or bitter). GILLS white to slightly yellowish in old age, attached (typically decurrent at least by lines, but ranging to adnate or even adnexed); close. STALK 5-20 cm long, 1-5 cm thick, tough, solid, equal or enlarged at the middle or below (often with a narrowed base); white, discoloring slightly in age; base usually im-bedded in a white mycelial mat; smooth or often scaly (especially in mid-portion). SPORE_PRINT white; spores 5.5-8.5 x 4-6 microns, elliptical, warty, amyloid. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious (often in large rings) in woods, mainly under conifers; widely distributed. It is common in our area in the cool winter months, particularly under redwood, but also with other trees, including eucalyptus. It is slow to grow and even slower to decay. EDIBILITY A tempting specimen, but I don't recommend it-even the non-bitterforms are coarse and difficult to digest. Thorough cooking would be necessary. "

Common_Name: Bitter Brown Leucopaxillus
Group?: No
CAP 5-12 (15) cm broad, broadly convex with an inrolled margin when young, becoming plane or slightly depressed; surface dry, unpolished, smooth, dark brown to brown, pecan-brown, or reddish-brown, evenly colored or paler at the margin, sometimes cracked or faded in age; margin often obscurely ribbed. Flesh thick, firm, dry, white; odor mild or pungent; taste very bitter. GILLS typically adnate but ranging from notched to slightly decurrent by lines; close, white. STALK 4-10 cm long, 0.5-2 (4) cm thick, equal or en-larged below, smooth, dry, solid, white or sometimes discolored brownish below; base imbedded in acopious white mycelial mat. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 4-6 x 3-5 microns, nearly round, warted, amyloid. Cystidia numerous on gill edges. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious (often in rings) under conifers and oaks; common and widely distributed. In our area it is often abundant in the fall and winter. EDIBILITY Unequivocally inedible-it smells like ""creepy crawlers"" and tastes like a mildewed army tent. If you're lost in the woods and have nothing to eat, you'd do better to follow the example of Charlie Chaplin and stew your boots before venturing to make a meal of this mushroom. "

Group?: Yes
CAP 2-7 (10) cm broad, broadly convex to plane to shallowly depressed, often with a low broad umbo; surface smooth, hygrophanous but not viscid; dark brown to gray to grayish-brown when moist, often fading to buffy-tan, gray, or even paler in sunlight (or as it dries). Flesh thin, whitish, odor mild. GILLS narrow, close or crowded, white, usually notched but varying to adnate or even very slightly decurrent. STALK 2-8 cm long, 3-6 (12) mm thick, equal or with a slightly swollen base, rather slender. stiff, whitish or with darker (brown) fibrils, apex sometimes minutely scaly or scurfy. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 6-8 x 4-5.5 microns, elliptical, minutely warted, amyloid. Harpoonlike cystidia typically present on gill edges. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious on ground in open places (lawns, pastures, etc.), under trees, along roads and trails, in straw and wood chips, and also in the woods; common and widely distributed, but usually fruiting at lower elevations. Common in our area throughout the mushrom season but most numerous in the winter and early spring. EDIBILITY Edible. The caps are delicious fried in butter, but since it is not an easy mushroom to recognize, I hesitate to recommend it. Also, the edibility of closely related species has not been adequately ascertained. "
