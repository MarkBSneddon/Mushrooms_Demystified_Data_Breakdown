It is common along the west coast from Alaska to southern California and fruits in our area from early fall through spring or even summer. It was the single most abundant mushroom on the University of California, Santa Cruz campus (a very ""disturbed"" place!) during the 1976-77 drought. A couple hundred pounds could easily have been harvested. EDIBILITY Edible and quite popular in some regions, but it hardly tastes like chicken as its common name implies. I've found it to be crunchy, but bland. Its abundance and habit of fruiting when other good edibles are scarce make experimentation worthwhile. Be careful, however-this is a species"" complex,"" and some mild cases of poisoning have been attributed to it. These may simply have been ""allergic"" reactions, or may have resulted from confusion with poisonous species (e.g., Clilocybe dUalala). "

It is partial to conifers in most areas (including the Pacific Northwest), but is locally common in the late fall and winter with live oak, and less commonly pine. EDIBILITY To be avoided, as evidenced by the following severely censored excerpt from an erstwhile colleague's memoirs: ""This common, viscid, red-brown Tricholoma is delicious when stewed slowly with zucchini and served steaming hot on rice with chicken chow mein and white wine. Suffering from an acute attack of overconfidence, M. Henis and C. Cole tried it in this manner one winter evening in order to determine its edibility. They subsequently staggered thrugh an all-night ordeal of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, in which not only the mushroom, but everything else, was expelled. . ."" It is probable, then, that this common, viscid, red-brown Tricholoma is poisonous, although a violent allergic reaction on the part of M. Henis and C. Cole cannot be ruled out entirely. It is suggested that those foolish enough to try it (or any other mushroom of unknown edibility) should do so in extremely small amounts-without the rice, chicken chow mein, and white wine, and by all means, regardless of one's nutritional needs, culinary quirks, or dietary deficiencies, without the zucchini.

"Genus: Armillaria
Species: olida
Common_Name: Cucumber Armillaria
Group?: No
CAP 6-15 cm broad, convex becoming plane to broadly umbonate, or in age often depressed or with an uplifted margin; surface dry to somewhat viscid, color variable: whitish (when still under the duff) to gray to bluish-gray, purplish-gray, brown, or developing olive, buff, or ochre tones; often overlaid with white cottony or fibrillose veil remnants (these sometimes scattered but more often merged to form a central patch). Flesh thick, firm, white; odor very distinctive: usually like cucumber, watermelon rind, rotting potatoes, or freshly mowed grass, but sometimes like old fish. GILLS close, white or tinged gray, typically adnexed or notched but sometimes adnate when very young and free in old age. STALK 6-14 cm long, 1.84 cm thick, equal or swollen below (or even with a bulb), solid, very firm, dry, white or at times pale buff, usually sheathed below the ring by veil remnants which are often ochre-or cinnamon-tinged. VEIL cottony or fibrillose, usually forming a slight median to superior ring on the stalk, but sometimes disappearing. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 9-12.5 x 4.5-6.5 microns, elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Solitary to gregarious or in small clumps of 2-3 individuals in duff under mountain conifers, often partially buried or forming ""mushrumps""; known only from the West, fruiting during the spring or shortly after the snow melts. It is quite common in the Sierra Nevada and is sometimes a good morel-indicator. I have seen large fruitings in Yosemite National Park in April. EDIBILITY Unknown-or at least not commonly eaten. The taste is said to resemble the odor, which is not particularly pleasing. "

HABITAT Solitary or in scattered groups in woods and along paths; widely distributed. It is common under conifers in the mountains of western North America in spring, summer, and early fall, but I find it only rarely in our area, usually under oak. EDIBILITY Edible but insipid-I have fried it. The closely related A. straminea (see comments) is said to be a popular edible mushroom in Colorado. "
"Genus: Catathelasma
Species: imperialis
Common_Name: Imperial Mushroom
Group?: No
CAP 10-40 cm broad, convex to plane; surface slightly viscid when moist but soon dry, smooth, fibrillose-scaly, or cracked into scales or plaques(areolate); dark brown to brown, dingy yellow-brown, or olive-brown. Flesh very thick(up to 15 em!) and hard, white; odor and taste sharply farinaceous. GILLS decurrent, pallid or buff to yellowish or pale grayish-olive (in age), close, many forked. STALK 12-18 cm long, 3-8 cm thick, tapered below to a bluntly pointed base; dry, dingy brownish to pinkish-buff below the ring; solid, hard. VEIL membranous, double-layered, its lower surface often areolate while still covering the gills; typically forming a double ring, the upper one thick, striate above, and often flaring; the lower one sheathing the stalk as a thin membrane or gelatinous zone, or indistinct. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 10-15x 4-5.5 microns, cylindrical, smooth, amyloid. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups on ground under conifers (mainly spruce and fir), late summer and fall, northern North America. It is more common in the Rocky Mountains than on the west coast. It does not occur in our area, but C. ventricosa (see comments) is fairly common under Sitka spruce in northern California. EDIBILITY Edible and very tempting because of its size-but tough. Buttons are as large as baseballs, and just as hard! "
"Genus: Armillariella
Species: mellea
Common_Name: Honey Mushroom
Group?: Yes
CAP 3-15 cm broad or more, convex becoming plane or sometimes broadly umbonate or in age uplifted; surface viscid or dry, usually with scattered minute dark brown to blackish fibrillose scales or erect hairs, especially toward the center; color variable: yellow, yellow-brown, tawny, tan, pinkish-brown, reddish-brown, etc. Flesh thick and white when young, sometimes discolored in age; odor mild, taste usually latently bitter. GILLS adnate to slightly decurrent or sometimes notched; white to yellowish or sordid flesh-color, often spotted darker in age. STALK 5-20 cm long, 0.5-3 (5) cm thick, tough and fibrous with a stringy pith inside; usually tapered below if growing in large clusters, or enlarged below if unclustered and on the ground; dry, whitish above the ring, soon yellowish to reddish-brown below and often cottony-scaly when very young. VEIL cottony-membranous, white to yellowish, forming a superior ring on stalk or occasionally disappearing. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 6-10 x 5-6 microns, elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT In small or massive clusters on stumps, logs, and living trees, or scattered to gregarious (occasionally solitary) on ground-but growing from roots or buried wood; common on a wide variety of trees and shrubs, and practically worldwide in distribution. In our area it occurs year-round, but is most common in the fall and early winter. I have seen truly stupendous fruitings on oak as. well as walnut (in an orchard) and other trees. It is a virulent parasite of timber, fruit, and garden trees, but can also be a harmless saprophyte on dead trees or on the dead wood (heartwood) ofliving trees. It is called ""oak root fungus"" in California because of its insatiable appetite for oaks, and ..shoe string root rot"" because of the stringy black mycelial strands (rhizomorphs) by which the mycelium spreads. These ..runners"" may extend up the host's trunk or infect neighboring trees by traversing great distances through the soil. on oak trees the mycelium can frequently be seen as whitish fanlike growths between the bark and wood. It generally feeds on the roots and lower trunk of its host, reducing it to a pathetic white, spongy pulp. The mycelium is also thought to be the culprit responsible for the ..aborted"" fruiting bodies of Entoloma abortivum. Actively growing mycelium may phosphoresce at night, giving the wood an eerie luminous aura called ..foxfire."" Inhabitants of subarctic regions are said to mark their trails with bits of glowing wood infected by A. mellea. EDIBILITY Eminently edible. Use only firm caps and discard the tough stalks. It is an abundant food source, crunchy in texture, and a very passable substitute for the shiitake (Lentinus edodes) in stir-fried dishes. The bitter taste cooks out, but some forms are better than others, and some (e.g., those that grow on buckeye or hemlock) can cause digestive upsets. The common name, incidentally, is a reference to its color (which, like honey, is extremely variable), not its taste (which isn't the least bit sweet). "

Cap cuticle staining rusty-brown to reddish-brown in KOH (potassium hydroxide). HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups under or near conifers, especially in moss; widely distributed in northern regions and probably the most common member of the genus. I have seen it in late summer, fall, and early winter in northern California and the Pacific Northwest, but it does not seem to occur south of San Francisco. EDIBILITY Not recommended. Some sources list it as edible, but it doesn't have much substance and can be confused with poisonous species (e.g., Lepiota castanea). "

SPORE_PRINT white; spores 7-10 x 4-6 microns, elliptical to somewhat irregular, apiculate, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Gregarious in grass, usually in arcs or rings; widely distributed and very common in lawns, parks, cemeteries, etc.; also common in pastures in the Pacific North-west, but rarely straying far from suburbia in our area. Found year-round except during cold spells, but most abundant in California in late spring, summer (on watered lawns), and fall. Several crops are prod uced each year, but its presence can be detected even when it isn't fruiting-just look for ""fairy rings"" (patches of brown grass rimmed by a lush zone of darker green grass). The living mycelium on the periphery ofthe ring stimulates the grass to grow, while the dried-up mycelial matter within the circle inhibits growth. EDIBILITY Delectably delicious-one of the few ""LBM's"" worth learning. What it lacks in substance it makes up for in abundance. Discard the tough stems and use the caps whole. They're superb is just about anything-omelets, soups, sauces, stir-fried dishes, even cookies. or simply saute in butter and serve on toast! What's more, they dry easily, don't decay quickly, and are usually free of maggots. Don't pass up shrivelled, sun-dried specimens-they are easily resurrected or can be stored in an airtight jar for later use. "
