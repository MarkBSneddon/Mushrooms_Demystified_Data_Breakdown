"Genus: Astraeus
Species: hygrometricus
Common_Name: Hygroscopic Earthstar
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY round to flattened when young, the outer-wall splitting at maturity into 6-15 pointed rays; 1-5 (8) cm broad when fully expanded. RAYS hygroscopic (unfolding in wet weather and closing up over the spore case in dry weather), often unequal in length, tough and leathery when moist, hard when dry; underside (exterior) fibrillose, usually with adhering sand and sometimes with black hairlike threads (rhizomorphs) at base; upper surface (interior) at first smooth, but often developing numerous cracks, pale tan darkening to brown, gray, or blackish-brown. SPORE_CASE 0.5-3 cm broad, round or somewhat flattened, sessile (without a stalk), thin and papery; surface whitish to grayish or brownish and roughened by particles (andlor finely reticulate); rupturing at maturity through an irregular or poorly defined apical pore or slit. SPORE_MASS brown to cocoa-brown and powdery when mature. Spores 7-11 microns, round, finely warted. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious in old fields, sand or sandy soil, pastures, roadsides, waste places, etc.; worldwide in distribution. It grows from sea level to above timberline, from verdant pastures to desert wastelands. In our area it fruits mainly in the fall, but the tough fruiting bodies persist for months without decaying. I have seen hundreds of spiderlike fruiting bodies in Arizona under pinyon pine, but when the weathered, blackened outer skins (rays) are found without their spore cases, they look like old tire patches.

Spores 8-13 microns, round, strongly reticulate. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups or clumps on ground and rotten wood, usually in forests but sometimes in gardens or in sandy or disturbed soil; widespread and the most common of all Scleroderma species. Although it is more typically a northern than a southern species, I have seen enormous fruitings in the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. In our area I have found it in a garden in October, but it is rare-at least in comparison to other species. EDIBILITY Poisonous! If eaten raw or consumed in quantity it causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and even chills or cold sweats. Nevertheless, it has been used by some unscrupu-lous individuals to adulterate truffles. "

Species: tinctorius
Common_Name: Dead Man's Foot
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 5-30 cm or more high and 4-20 cm broad, at first round to pear-shaped, then club-shaped (i.e., usually but not always with a narrowed, rooting base or ""stalk""), finally breaking up in age or taking on the appearance of a large dusty root or stump; odor mild to aromatic or unpleasant, depending on the age. SPORE_CASE with a thin, brittle peridium (skin) that is variously colored (but usually yellowish, purplish, olive-black, or brown) and often lustrous and soon ruptures irregularly or flakes away. Upper portion of fruiting body containing hundreds of seedlike peridioles which gradually disintegrate, turning into a crumbly or dusty mass of brown spores (the disintegration process starts at the top of fruiting body and proceeds downward). Peridioles small (24 mm long), elongated to oval or circular, whitish to greenish-yellow, yellow, brownish, or vinaceous, at first imbedded in a sticky dark or blackish substance which dries out and becomes brittle or crumbly at maturity. Lower portion of fruiting body typically consisting of a fibrous, stalklike, persistent, sterile, rooting base which may have coarse greenish-yellow mycelial fibers attached. VOLVA absent. SPORE_MASS powdery when mature, dark brown to cinnamon-brown. Spores 7-12 microns, round, warty or spiny. HABITAT Solitary, widely scattered, or in small groups on or along roads, in waste places, and in hardpacked, poor, sandy, or gravelly soil; very widely distributed, but especially common in California and the Pacific N orthwest(the largest fruitings I've seen were in the Siskiyou Mountains of northern California). In our area it fruits chiefly in the late summer and fall, but is slow to decay and can be found most any time. It forms mycorrhiza with a wide range of trees and shrubs (oak, pine, etc.) and is said to be of value in reforestation projects. EDIBILITY Not recommended. In Europe it is known as the ""Bohemian Truffle"" and used as an aromatic seasoning when unripe, and in China it is employed medicinally. It is scarcely appetizing, however, and should be tried very cautiously, if at alL The name tinctorius reflects its use as a dye-a variety of rich colors (mostly browns and golds, but also blacks and dark blues) can be obtained, depending on the mordants used and the type of soil in which it is found.

"Genus: Dictyocephalos
Species: attenuatus
Common_Name: Stalked Oddball
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY beginning underground as an ""egg"" completely encased in a mem-brane, the stalk then elongating ra pidly and the ruptured outer membrane forming a volva at its base. Mature fruiting body consisting of a spore case mounted on a tough stalk. SPORE_CASE round to somewhat flattened or even depressed on top, or irregular(e.g., sometimes with several lobes), 2-6 cm high and 5-13 cm broad, seated on a disclike enlarge-ment of the stalk apex which is white to brownish in old specimens. Outer peridium(skin) fleshy to slightly gelatinous when young, becoming tougher and developing brown to reddish scales or warts which vary from small, flat, and more or less persistent to large, pyramidal and deciduous; lower margin sometimes with a hanging ""veil"" composed of adhering tissue stripped from the stalk during expansion. Inner layer of peridium 1-2 mm thick, usually paler(whitish to buff) than outer peridium, but sometimes darkeninginage. Upper portion of spore case breaking up into irregular pieces which fall away; lower portion tougher and persisting as a more or less bowl-shaped structure. STALK (5) 10-40 (52) cm long, 2-5 cm thick at apex, equal or more often tapered downward (rarely thicker below or bulbous), the base sometimes pointed and free of the volva, sometimes with 1-2 rootlike mycelial cords attached; solid (or with insect cavities), sometimes forked (with one spore case on each branch), fleshy-tough becoming woody when dry; at first white, but becoming brown in age; often grooved, ridged, andlor flattened and sometimes twisted; often cracking, peeling, or curling back to form scales or sometimes even an irregular ""ring"" or ""annulus:' VOLVA at base of stalk saclike, but occasionally poorly developed or absent; white to tan when fresh, 3-11 cm high; tough, hard, or chalky in age. SPORE_MASS divided up into numerous whitish-walled ""cells"" (peridioles), but all but the lowermost ""cell"" walls disintegrating, so that the mature spore mass is brown and powdery, usually with an unpleasant odor (like decaying fish); lowermost ""cell"" walls often persisting after the spores have been dispersed as flattened, pointed ""teeth"" on the inner surface of the spore case, giving it a pitted or reticulate appearance. Spores 5-7 microns, round or nearly round, warted or spiny. HABITAT Solitary, widely scattered, or in small groups (often in tufts of 2-5 individuals and occasionally two emerging from a single volva) in barren sandy soil or clay, waste places, etc. It is widespread in the arid and semi-arid parts of the West, but is most com-mon in the deserts of southern California, the Four Corners area, and the Southwest-often near or under saltbush (A triplex) or along washes. It fruits after seasonal rains, but the fruiting bodies are practically impervious to bacterial and fungal decay, persisting for as long as 30 years in their natural environment! Mature specimens can protrude from the soil like dusty roots (in the grand tradition of Pisolithus tinctorius), or remain underground, depending on the hardness of the soil and weather conditions. W. H. Long, who gathered a gaggle of them near Antelope Valley, California, reports that developing specimens raised hard blocks of soil weighing 15 pounds each!
