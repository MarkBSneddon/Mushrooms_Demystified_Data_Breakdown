HABITAT In tufts or clusters on or near stumps, logs, and roots of hardwoods (but sometimes appearing terrestrial); very widely distributed. It is fairly common in our area from fall through spring on poplar and willow, and in coastal sand dunes on bush lupine. In the Rocky Mountains it is abundant in the late summer on aspen; in eastern North America it fruits from the late fall through early spring on elm and other hardwoods. EDIBILITY Edible, but the sticky skin should be removed before cooking. In colder regions it is an important edible and is called the 'winter mushroom"" because it fruits very late in the season (even during winter thaws) when other fungi are not available. In our balmy climate, however, its season coincides with that of other, more flavorful mushrooms, so it is not often gathered. A cultivated form of it called the ""snow-puff mushroom"" or enokitake can be bought in many markets. It looks something like a pure white bean sprout with its long, smooth (not velvety!) stem and negligible cap. "
