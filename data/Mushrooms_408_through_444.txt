CAP 3-10 cm broad, convex to broadly convex or broadly umbonate; surface viscid or slimy when moist, bright yellow to dull yellowish, olive-yellow, ochre-yellow, or dark yel-low, with scattered reddish to cinnamon-brown or dark brown spots, scales, streaks, or patches of fibrils, especially toward the margin (but these sometimes washed off by rain); margin incurved and usually hung with cottony veil remnants. Flesh soft, thin, yellow, not bl ueing but often staining vinaceous or pinkish when bruised. PO R ES large (1-2 mm wide) when mature, often somewhat radially arranged, mustard-yellow becoming duller or darker (ochre to yellow-brown) in age, not blueing when bruised (but may stain vinaceous or pinkish); tubes same color or dingier. STALK 3-11 cm long, 0.5-1.5 cm thick, more or less equal, often curved, solid or sometimes hollow in age, yellow to ochre-yellow, often staining vinaceous or brown when handled and often vinaceous-stained at or in the base; gland ular dots and smears present, often inconspicuous when young but typically brown to cinnamon and quite conspicuous in age.

SPORE_PRINT brown to dull cinnamon-brown; spores8-12x 3.5-4.5 microns, elliptical to spindle-shaped, smooth. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious or clustered under conifers, associated with white (5-needle) pines; widely distributed, but especially common in the summer and fall with western white pine in the Pacific Northwest and northern California. It is also found in the Southwest with southwestern white pine and limber pine.The very similar S. ameri-canus(see comments) replaces it in eastern North America.

CAP 4-18 cm broad, convex becoming broadly convex or plane; surface smooth, slimy or viscid when moist, often shiny when dry; color extremely variable: usually white when very young but soon olive to grayish-olive and then becoming yellow, tawny-cinnamon, rusty-brown, orange, reddish-brown, or often mottled and streaked with various combinations of the above colors; margin typically naked or with a slight roll of cottony tissue when young. Flesh thick, white when young, soon becoming lemon-yellow and soft, not blueing; odor pungent or pleasant (somewhat banana-like).

STALK 2-10 cm long, 1-2 (3) cm thick, equal or with a-slightly tapered or swollen base, firm, solid, white when young becoming yellow in age, with conspicuous reddish to brown glandular dots and smears. VEIL absent. SPORE_PRINT olive-brown to dull cinnamon-brown; spores 9-10 x 3-3.5 microns, spindle-shaped to elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious or clustered on ground near or under M on-terey pine; apparently endemic to our area, but also occurring where Monterey pines ha ve been planted (it is a common ""lawn mushroom"" in our area, often growing with Chroo-gomphus vinicolor and Helvella lacunosa). It is most abundant in the fall and winter but can be found whenever it's damp enough. It is also quite common under knobcone and ponderosa pines-but apparently only within the geographical range of Monterey pine. EDIBILITY Edible; disdained by some due to its""harsh, unpleasant, subna useous"" taste, but prized by others. In my opinion its soft flesh and slimy texture are much bigger draw-backs than its flavor. Since it occurs in such large quantities and is easy to identify, it is definitely worth experimenting with. To remove the slime, simply peel off the skin. "

HABITAT Solitary or in small groups on or near rotting conifers (especially hemlock), but sometimes appearing terrestrial; common in the fall in the Pacific Northwest and northern California, also reported (rarely) from Michigan. It does not seem to venture south of San Francisco. (Neither does hemlock, and neither would I if I could help it.) EDIBILITY Edible and delicious-some collections have a distinct lemony flavor.

It is abundant some years, practically absent others; it often grows with B. satanas, B. regius, andlor B. aereus. EDIBILITY Edible and popular (although some people are ""allergic"" to it). It lacks the nuttiness of B. edulis but is remarkable for its firmness-a joy to find as well as to eat, something you can really sink your teeth into.

In the Sierra Nevada and Cascades it grows under conifers in the spring, summer, and fall.

PORES red to brick-red to orange-red, orange, rusty-orange, or burnt sienna (but sometimes yellowish in old age), blueing quickly when bruised; tubes yellow becoming greenish-yellow in age. STALK 4-15 cm long, (1.5) 2-4 (5) cm thick, equal or thicker at either end but not bulbous; yellowish or more often masked by a coating of minute red to orange dots or granules; blueing quickly when bruised and often dingier (darker or browner) in age; solid, firm, often curved; not reticulate or only very slightly so at apex from decurrent tube walls. SPORE_PRINT olive-brown to ochraceous-brown; spores 12-16 x 4-6 microns, elliptical to spindle-shaped, smooth. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious on ground in woods; widely distributed. It is fairly common under conifers (especially spruce) from northern California to Alaska, and under both hardwoods and conifers in eastern North America; also reported from the Rocky Mountains. In the oak and madrone woodlands of California it is replaced by B. amygdalinus (see comments). EDIBILITY Poisonous to some people-to be avoided. Two books which list B. satanas as poisonous state flatly that B. erythropus is edible. However, Bill Everson (an intrepid Californian toadstool-tester) was unaffected by cooked B. satanas but ate a small portion of sauteed B. erythropus and vomited soon after-an explicit example of why you should be cautious when trying any mushroom for the first time, even a so-called ""edible"" one!

HABITAT Solitary or scattered to gregarious under both hardwoods and conifers, fruiting mainly in the summer and fall; apparently endemic to the drier parts of western North America and Mexico. It is a warm weather species and more abundant in Arizona and New Mexico than anywhere else. There it is associated almost exclusively with ponde-rosa pine, while B. edulis favors spruce. In Colorado, however, I have found it under spruce and fir, and in coastal California it is usually associated-quite curiously-with live oak, while B. edulis grows with pine. In our area it fruits in the fall and winter, but is abundant only after warm early (September-N ovember) rains. EDIBILITY Delectably delicious. It is a favorite of collectors in the Southwest, and in the completely objective opinion of its ""discoverer,"" Chuck Barrows, it is the best of the boletes for the table. Unfortunately, the maggots share his opinion, for they attack it even more voraciously than they do B. edulis! "

HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups or sometimes troups on ground in woods; found throughout the world and very common in western North America. It favors coni-fers (pine, spruce, hemlock, fir) but also grows with hardwoods such as oak and birch. It is often abundant in our coastal pme forests in the fall and winter(usually 2-4 weeks after the first substantial fall rains) as well as under oak, and a smaller flush may appear in the spring. In coastal northern California and oregon it grows with pine and spruce in the fall; in the Sierra Nevada a stout form fruits in large quantities under conifers in the spring, summer, and fall; and in the high Rockies the variety with a dark red cap fruits in colossal quantities in August and September, under spruce. EDIBILITY one of the finest offleshy fungi and certainly the best-loved and most sought-after in Europe, where it has more common names than there are languages. If any mushroom deserves the dubious title of ""king,"" this is the one. It is a consummate crea-tion, the peerless epitome of earthbound substance, a bald bulbous pillar of thick white flesh-the one aristocrat the peasantry can eat! The entire fruiting body is exceptionally delicious, even the tubes ifthey're firm enough. It is delicious raw, but can cause stomach upsets because it's difficult to digest, so play it safe and cook it (preferably on high heat in an open pan, so as to drive off the excess mois-ture). The odor and taste of dried B. edulis are marvelous-nutty, earthy, and meaty all at once. But you have to find them before you can eat them. and it isn't always easy. You can't just casually look for them the way you can forchanterelles or blewits-you have to hunt them down and root them up from under the duff before they're visible to others. Timing is of paramount importance, because you face formidable competition from both maggots and boletivores(see p. 546). one source suggests getting up at the crack of dawn and wearing your shirt inside out. Uthatdoesn't work, you can always resort to the dried, imported version found in delicatessens. "
