Common_Name: Oak Conk
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY shelf-like or bracket-like, often perennial; tough and corky when fresh. CAP 2.5-15 cm broad and 1-3 cm thick; fan-shaped or semi-circular in outline; surface at first velvety (just the growing margin if perennial), becoming rough to nearly smooth andlor somewhat zoned; bright rusty-yellow to ochraceous when young(as is the growing margin of older specimens), dark rusty-brown and finally blackish in age; not in-crusted. Flesh tough, bright ochraceous to dark yellow-brown or colored like cap. PORES minute (4-8 per mm), grayish-brown becoming reddish-brown or dark brown; tubes in 1-5 layers, each 1-5 mm long. STALK absent. SPORE_PRINT whitish; spores 4-5 x 2.5-3.5 microns (but rarely found), oblong-elliptical, smooth. Large brown sterile cells (setae) abundant among the basidia. Cap tissue blackening in potassium hydroxide (KOH). HABITAT Solitary or more often in colonies on dead or occasionally living hardwoods (rarely on conifers); widely distributed. It occurs year-round in our area on oak and tan-oak and is our most common perennial polypore of dead hardwoods. It produces a general delignifying decay of the sapwood, rendering it whitish and very brittle. EDIBILITY Unknown. "
"Genus: Phellinus
Species: pini
Common_Name: Pine Conk
Group?: No

CAP 2-20 cm broad and 1-15 cm thick; hoof-shaped to convex or fan-shaped; surface hard, often crusty but not shiny; rough or cracked, minutely hairy orroughened(like sandpaper) at first, often concentrically grooved in age; tawny to rusty-brown becoming brown to reddish-brown or brownish-black in age; margin sometimes brighter. Flesh less than I cm thick, tough, tawny to rusty-reddish or ochre. PORES 2-5 per mm, round to irregularly sinuous, ochraceous-tawny to rusty-brown becoming brown; tubes 2-5 mm long, in one or several layers. STALK absent or rudimentary. SPORE_PRINT brown; spores 4 x 3.5-5 microns, round or nearly round, smooth. Large brown sterile cells (setae) intermingled with basidia. Cap tissue blackening in potassium hydroxide (KOH). HABITAT Solitary or more often in rows or columns up and down living or recently conifers; widely distributed and common, infecting all important members of the pine family (pine, Douglas-fir, etc.). Perennial, in our area occurring mainly on pine. It attacks the heartwood and sometimes the sapwood ofliving trees, resulting in a delignifying pocket rot known as ""conch rot."" The fruiting bodies are largely confined to older trees, partly because years of growth must take place before the mycelium can fruit. As a result, the appearance of a single fruiting body means that extensive heart rot has already taken place 10-15 feet above and below it. This fungus is said to cause more timber loss than any other. EDIBILITY Inedible (but see comments on edibility of Fomitopsis pinicola). "
"Genus: Piptoporus

Flesh punky or corky, thick, white. PORES appearing recessed due to curblike margin, 24 per mm; white when fresh, in age becoming pale brown or grayish-brown and occasionally torn up or toothlike; tubes 2-10 mm long, one layer only. STALK absent or present only as a stubby extension of the cap; lateral or attached to top of cap. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 3-6 x 1.5-2 microns, cylindrical to sausage-shaped, smooth. HABITAT Solitary or in groups or columns on dead or sometimes living birch trees; common year-round in the northern hemisphere throughout the range of birch. I have not seen it in California, undoubtedly because birch does not occur naturally. However, it is found in Washington and Idaho and is very abundant in northeasternN orthAmerica. It causes a reddish-brown to yellow-brown carbonizing decay. EDIBILITY Edible when young (according to McIlvaine), but tough. The fruiting bodies are quite attractive, however, and have enjoyed a variety of non-culinary uses, e.g., as tinder, as a razor strop, and as a mounting medium for pinned insect specimens. "

"Genus: Thelephora
Species: terrestris
Common_Name: Earth Fan; Fiber Vase
Group?: Yes
FRUITING_BODY annual but persistent, tough; usually vase-shaped to fanlike, often clustered or in confluent masses, sometimes bracket-like or shelf-like on plant stems. CAP 2-5 cm broad or forming rosettes or clusters up to 12 cm broad; surface dry, with radiating silky fibrils or small scales; brown to reddish-or chocolate-brown to grayish-brown or fuscous, often darker in age; margin usually fringed, splitting, often paler or whitish.

HABITAT Occasionally solitary but more often in groups or clusters in humus, sandy soil, and decomposing vegetable matter; sometimes on old stumps or climbing up herbaceous stems or tree seedlings; widespread and common. In our area it grows year-round, but is easily overlooked. I've seen it several times on potted plants in nurseries. EDIBILITY I can find no information on it. "
"Genus: Thelephora
Species: palmata
Common_Name: Fetid False Coral
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY annual, erect, usually profusely branched from a common base; 2-10 cm high and just as broad or broader. BRANCHES purplish-brown to chocolate-brown or darker, flattened; tips also flattened (palmlike) and usually paler (whitish) when actively growing. STALK present only as a common base or short ""trunk"" below the branches. Flesh tough, leathery; odor garliclike becoming fetid (unpleasant) in age. SPORE_PRINT dark reddish-brown; spores 8-11 x 7-8 microns, elliptical-angular, spiny. HABITAT Solitary or in groups on moist ground in woods and at their edges; widely distributed. It often grows along woodland paths but blends uncannily into its sur-roundings. In our area it fruits in the late fali, winter, and spring, but is not particularly common. EDIBILITY Unknown. "
"Genus: Phlebia
Species: radiata
Common_Name: N/A
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY annual, resupinate (lying flat on substrate), sometimes with a free margin but no cap or stalk; soft when fresh, tough in age. FERTILE SURFACE usually fused to form patches 30 cm or more long, but often with smaller, discrete systems of radiating wrinkles or warty veins 1-4 cm broad; flesh-colored to bright orange to pinkish-red, fading to whitish inoldage. Underside ofmargin(iffree) with white woolly hairs. Flesh thin, rather soft or slightly gelatinous when fresh, tough in age or when dry. SPORE_PRINT whitish; spores 3.5-7 x 1-3 microns, sausage-shaped or elliptical. smooth. HABITAT on fallen logs and branches of both hardwoods and conifers; widely dis-tributed. I find it occasionally on oak logs in the fall and winter. EDIBILITY Inedible. It looks as if it has already been eaten (see comments). "
"Genus: Serpula
Species: lacrymans
Common_Name: Dry Rot Fungus
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY annual, forming widely-spreading, nearly flat, fanlike sheets on horizontal substrates, but sometimes bracket-like if growing on vertical substrates; soft and spongy when fresh, 5 cm-l m (3 ft.) broad or more. Upper surface (or free margin) silvery-white to gray, hairy. Flesh thin, dingy yellowish; odor often unpleasant, musty. FERTILE SURF ACE consisting of very shallow (I mm deep), large, irregular pits orLLpores"" formed by a honeycomb-like network of folds and ridges rather than by tubes; olive-yellow to brownish-yellow, rusty-brown, orange-brown, or cinnamon. STALK typically absent, but white or grayish mycelial strands (by which it spreads) often present. SPORE_PRINT orange-brown to orange-yellow to brownish; spores 8-12.5 x 4-6 microns, elliptical, smooth, thick-walled. HABITAT A serious pest of structural wood in old houses, buildings, ships, etc., usually developing indoors or in poorly ventilated situations, often hiding under floorboards. Bulging wood and a musty odor are telltale signs of its presence. Common in Europe, where the ventilation in many houses was sealed off during the war; less common in North America. It is called dry rot because it extracts water from the wood and cracks it into cubical blocks, eventually reducing it to a fine, dark powder. A related species,S. himan-tioides, turns up occasionally in the wild (on dead conifers), as do Merulius species (see comments). EDIBILITY Utterly and indisputably inedible. "
"Genus: Echinodontium
Species: tinctorium
Common_Name: Indian Paint Fungus; Toothed Conk
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY shelf-like, very tough or woody, often perennial, up to 15 cm thick. CAP 4-25 cm broad, more or less hoof-shaped; surface dry, finely hairy to rough, often covered with moss. Flesh very tough or woody, bright orange to rusty-red or cinnamon, zoned. SPINES brittle, blunt, thick, flattened, long (1-3 cm); grayish to pale olive-buff, the tips sometimes darker. STALK absent. SPORE_PRINT white (when obtainable); spores 5.5-8 x 3.5-6 microns, elliptical, minutely spiny, amyloid. HABITAT Solitary or several on living or occasionally downed conifers; known only from western North America, where it favors mountain conifers such as fir and hemlock (I haven't seen it on the coast). It causes an extensive white heart rot in its host. EDIBILITY Unequivocally inedible, but can be used as a red dye. Its common name is a tribute to its use by Native Americans in the preparation of war paint. "
"Genus: Hericium
Species: abietis
Common_Name: Conifer Coral Hericium
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 10-75 cm or more broad and high at maturity, consisting of an open to compact branched framework from which tufts of icicle-like spines hang; branches arising from a thick, tough, rooting base; color variable: white to creamy, yellowish-buff, pale ochraceous, or salmon-buff. SPINES up to 25 mm long but usually 5-10 mm; soft but brittle, arranged in tufts or clusters that are mainly grouped at the branch tips. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 4.5-5.5 x 4-5 microns, round or nearly round, smooth or minutely roughened, amyloid. HABITAT Solitary or sometimes several together on dead conifers (especially fir and Douglas-fir); known only from the Pacific Northwest and northern California, fruiting mainly in the fall. It is rather infrequent but locally common, particularly at higher eleva-tions (the largest fruitings I've seen were in the Cascades). It appears year after year on the same logs, causing a conspicuous white pocket rot. The closely related H. coralloides (see comments) favors hardwoods and is more widely distributed. EDIBILITY Eminently edible, delectably delicious. When thoroughly cooked it is reminiscent of fish and is excellent sauteed, curried, or marinated. Its large size (a 100-lb. specimen was wheeled into one mushroom show!)plus its distinctive appearance make it an excellent mushroom for beginners. However, its breathtaking beauty poses a minor moral dilemma: should one ruthlessly uproot it for the sake of a meal, or leave it for others to see? "
"Genus: Hericium
Species: ramosum
Common_Name: Comb Hericium
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 8-35 cm broad and 6-15 cm high when mature, comprised of an open framework of rather delicate, toothed (spine-laden) branches arising from a tough, repeatedly branched rooting base or ""trunk""; pure white when fresh, discoloring creamy to buff or yellowish-tan in old age. Flesh white. SPINES more or less evenly distributed in lines along the branches (like teeth on a comb), sometimes also in small tufts at the branch tips; spines rather short (3-10 mm long or up to 25 mm long in the tufts). SPORE_PRINT white; spores 3-5 x 3-4 microns, nearly round, smooth or minutely roughened, amyloid. HABITAT Solitary or in small groups on fallen hard wood branches, logs, and stumps; widely distributed. It is said to be the most common Hericium in North America, but like the others, is uncommon in our area. I have found it in the fall, winter, and early spring on dead oak, and I have seen it in the summer on aspen and poplar in New Mexico. EDIBILITY Edible and delicious when cooked slowly, but not as fleshy as the other Hericiums. "
"Genus: Hericium
Species: erinaceus
Common_Name: Lion's Mane Hericium; Old Man's Beard
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY an unbranched mass of numerous long, closely-packed, icicle-like spines hanging from a tough, solid, hairy, rooting cushion of tissue; 8-40 cm or more broad and high when mature; entirely white when fresh, discoloring yellowish to tan or dingy ochre in age. Flesh white. SPINES (1) 2-5 (7) cm long, soft and pliant when fresh, with pointed tips. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 5-6.5 x 4-5.5 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, smooth to minutely roughened, amyloid. HABITAT Solitary (rarely several together) on wounds of living hard woods or on the cut ends of recently felled logs; widely distributed. In our area it favors oak and is fairly common (for a Hericium) in the fall, winter, and spring; farther north it grows on maple. EDIBILITY Excellent when fresh, but tougher than other Hericiums and sometimes developing a rather sour, unpleasant taste in age. Slow cooking is called for and the base should not be eaten-it's so tough that it's difficult to remove from the tree without a knife! "
"Genus: Dentinum
Species: repandum
Common_Name: Hedgehog Mushroom; Pig's Trotter
Group?: No
CAP 2-17 (25) cm broad, broadly convex to plane or depressed, the margin often wavy or deeply indented and at first inrolled; surface dry, more or less smooth, but sometimes cracking into scales in age; pale flesh-color to pale or dull orange, orange-tan, salmon, tan, or pale cinnamon to reddish-tawny (but white to creamy in vaT. album); bruised areas often darker orange. Flesh thick, occasionally zoned concentrically, firm, brittle, white, usually discoloring yellow to yellow-ochre or orange-brown when bruised; odor mild, taste mild to somewhat bitter or peppery. SPINES 2-7 mm long, whitish to yellowish, salmon-buff, or pale orange, bruising dark orange to ochraceous; slender, brittle but soft, usually decurrent. STALK 3-10 cm long, (0.5) 1-3 (5» cm thick, central or off-center, equal or enlarged below or occasionally tapered downward, firm, white or colored like cap but usually paler; bruising ochre to dark orange-brown; smooth or downy at base. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 6.5-9x 5.5-8 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, smooth. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, gregarious, or in troops on ground under both hard-woods and conifers; widely distributed throughout the north temperate zone and probably the most common of all the teeth fungi. In California it fruits throughout the mushroom season but develops slowly and normally does not peak until the late winter or early spring, when the wild irises are in bloom (see Color Plate 161) and most other fungi have long since rotted away. In our area it favors fern, bramble, and poison oak thickets under pine; in the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains it grows under a wide range of conifers, and in eastern North America it is often common under oaks in the summer and fall. EDIBILITY Edible and choice! It is comparable to the chanterelle in color, texture, and flavor, and like that species is usually maggot-free. It is easier to clean, however, and is also easier to recognize.The peppery taste (if present) disappears in cooking. It's superb in casseroles, tomato sauces, or sauteed with sour cream, but should be cooked slowly and lengthily to make it tender. Be careful to keep the spines clean while picking them! "
"Genus: Hydnum
Species: imbricatum
Common_Name: Shingled Hedgehog
Group?: No
Color Plate 159 CAP 5-20 cm broad, convex to plane or centrally depressed; surface dry, buff to pale brown or dull reddish-brown, but covered with large, coarse, broad, raised or shingle-like, darker brown to nearly black scales that are often upturned in age; becoming darker brown throughout in age and sometimes cracking, with the scales sometimes wearing off except at the center. Flesh thick, firm but brittle; pallid to grayish, tan, or brownish; odor mild or when dry somewhat smoky or chocolate-like; taste mild to bitter. SPINES pale brown or grayish or pallid becoming dark brown in age, 2-15 mm long; soft, brittle, often slightly decurrent. STALK 4-10 cm long, 1.5-3.5 (5) cm thick, central or off-center, often enlarged below; some shade of brown, often hollow toward the top in age; usually more or less smooth. SPORE_PRINT brown; spores 6-8 x 5-7 microns, nearly round but promi-nently warted (angular-nodulose or shaped like a Maltese cross). HABITAT Solitary to gregarious on ground in woods; widely distributed-it is pro bably the most common Hydnum in North America. In many regions it is abundant under conifers in the late spring, summer, and fall. In our area it occurs under hardwoods in the late fall and winter, but is rare. I have seen enormous fruitings under spruce and fir. EDIBILITY Edible, but of poor quality. Many collections have a bitter taste and par-boiling does not necessarily help, plus it causes indigestion in some people. The European version is apparently better because it is often sold in markets there. "

SPORE_PRINT brown; spores 6-7.5 x 4-5.5 microns, elliptical to round, prominently warted. Cap tissue staining blue-green in KOH. HABITAT Solitary to scattered or gregarious on ground under conifers or sometimes hardwoods; widely distributed. It is fairly common in the late summer and fall in the Pacific Northwest and northern California, but rare in our area. EDIBILITY Unequivocally and indisputably inedible due to the awful taste. "
"Genus: Hydnum
Species: calvatum
Common_Name: Robust Hedgehog
Group?: Yes
CAP (5) 10-25 (35) cm broad, convex to nearly plane or somewhat irregular; surface dry, soon breaking up into small, flattened scales and usually cracking in age; creamy-buff to yellowish-tan or pale cinnamon-brown, the scales slightly darker and becoming brownish where bruised; margin often lobed.
