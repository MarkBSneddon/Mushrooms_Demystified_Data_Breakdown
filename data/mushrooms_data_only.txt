Species: deliciosus
Common_Name: Delicious Milk Cap
Group?: No
CAP 5-16 cm broad, broadly convex or with a depressed center and an inrolled margin when young, becoming depressed or shallowly funnel-shaped; surface viscid when moist but soon dry, smooth, often zoned; color variable: dull orange to carrot-orange or orange-brown, sometimes blotched with or entirely green; fading in age or dry weather to brownish, gray, dull greenish-gray, or even yellowish; margin inrolled when young. Flesh thick, brittle, orange to yellowish or greenish; taste mild or slightly bitter. LATEX very scanty, bright carrot-orange (but in some forms slowly staining dark red when exposed), eventually staining wounded or aged tissue greenish (within 5 hours). GILLS typically bright to dull orange, but varying to yellowish or orange-buff, greenish where wounded; adnate to decurrent, close. STALK 2-7 cm long, 1-2.5 cm thick, equal or narrowed at base, soon dry, sometimes scrobiculate; rigid, hollow inage, frequently maggot-riddled, colored like cap or paler. SPORE_PRINT creamy yellowish-buff; spores 7-11 x 6-8 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, with amyloid ridges. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious or in troops under conifers (pine, spruce, etc.), common and widely distributed. It is abundant in our coastal pine forests in the late fall and winter, generally after the major crop of look-alike L. rubrilacteus. EDIBILITY Edible, but not necessarily delicious. Several varieties or forms occur and some are apparently better than others. Special treatment is required to overcome the grainy texture and latent bitterness. Its abundance and distinctiveness, however, make experimentation worthwhile. Some sources recommend slow cooking (e.g., baked in a casserole), others insist it should be cooked rapidly in a frying pan with very little butter. It is popular in Europe, and the Russians are fanatical about it-especially salted. "

Common_Name: Bleeding Milk Cap
Group?: No
CAP 4-14 cm broad, broadly convex with a depressed center and inrolled margin when young, depressed or shallowly funnel-shaped in age; surface viscid when moist, smooth, reddish-brown to orange, orange-brown, or tan, or often concentrically zoned with these colors; duller and greenish-stained in age. Flesh thick, brittle, brownish to buff, reddish, etc.; taste mild or slightly bitter. LATEX scanty, dark red (but occasionally orange-red in old specimens), slowly staining wounded areas greenish. GILLS adnate to slightly decurrent, close, reddish or dull purplish-red, or tan with a dark reddish sheen; greenish where wounded. STALK 2-6 cm long, 1-2.5 cm thick, equal or narrowed below, firm, rigid, hollow, colored like cap or paler, sometimes scrobiculate. SPORE_PRINT pale yellowish or buff; spores 7.5-10 x 6-8 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, with amyloid ridges. HABITAT Scattered or in large troops under conifers throughout the West; associated in our area with Douglas-fir and abundant in the fall and early winter. Where pines pre-dominate it is largely supplanted by L. deliciosus, and where pine and Douglas-fir grow together, the two milk caps often mingle. In Europe, L. sanguifluus (which may be the same as L. rubrilacteus) is mycorrhizal with pine. EDIBILITY Edible, but not pleasing to everyone because of its granular texture; usually better, however, than L. deliciosus (see comments on edibility of that species). "

It fruits in the fall and winter and, along with H. acutoconica, is usually the first of the brightly colored waxy caps to appear. Bob Winter says it often grows on lawns in Fresno, California. EDIBILITY Not recommended. It was once considered poisonous, perhaps due to its blackening qualities, but also because four deaths in China were (mistakenly?) attributed to it. Now it's generally regarded as harmless, but Larry Stickney, chef eXlra ordina ire, meandering mainstay of the Mycological Society of San Francisco, and an inimitable mushroom-loving marvel of a man, says it ""elicited an odd sensation of lightheadedness and numbness"" when he tried it.

I ruined an otherwise superb curry in my sole attempt to make it palatable. The sliced caps neither absorbed the surrounding spices nor contributed any special flavor of their own. The turmeric did turn them yellow, however, making them look for all the world like undercooked and overfed banana slugs-gummy, amorphous masses of slime that coagulated around or completely engulfed the peas and savory chunks of potato, rendering the entire dish inedible (though unforgettable).

It has a noble waxy texture and makes a toothsome meal. Although it lacks the supreme succulence of H. sordidus, it largely makes up for it in possessing a copious supply of wax, which coats the mouth and throat for hours after eating it, the way good ice cream does. All authorities pronounce it excellent. It is delightful scalloped or stewed, or better yet, made into catchu p and poured over food.

"Genus: Pleurotus
Species: ostreatus
Common_Name: Oyster Mushroom
Group?: No
CAP 4-15 cm broad or more, oyster-shaped or fan-shaped, convex becoming plane or sometimes funnel-shaped; surface smooth, slightly lubricous when moist but not viscid; color variable: white to gray, grayish-brown, tan, or dark brown (sometimes yellowish in old age); margin inrolled when young, often wavy or lobed. Flesh thick, white, firm but soft, tougher near the stalk; odor and taste mild. GILLS fairly close, broad, decurrent (if stalk is present), white or tinged gray but often discoloring yellowish in old age. STALK absent or if present usually short, stout, and off-center or lateral (but sometimes central); 0.5-4 cm long and thick; solid, firm, dry, usually hairy or downy at least at base. VEIL absent. SPORE_PRINT white to pale lilac or lilac-gray; spores 7-9 x 3-4 microns, oblong to elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Occasionally solitary but usually in shelving masses or overlapping rows or columns on hardwood logs and stumps; sometimes also on standing trees, rarely on conifers; common throughout most of the northern hemisphere. Its preferred hosts include elm, cottonwood, alder, and sycamore, but in our area it favors oak and tanoak, prod ucing large crops after the first fall rains and smaller crops thereafter through the spring. I have also seen stupendous fruitings (several hundred pounds!) growing in clusters in a treeless field where crushed coffee beans were dumped. It is easily cultivated on a wide variety of substrates, including compressed sawdust, shredded Time magazines, and presumably coffee grounds. If an ""oyster log"" is dragged home from the wild and kept moist, it will produce crops regularly. EDIBILITY Edible and delicious-breaded and fried it is superb and remarkably remi-niscent of seafood. Be sure to check for small beetles between the gills (these can be re-moved by dousing the mushroom briefly in water), and of course, for maggots. The tough stem or basal stump of tissue should be removed. Large specimens can be pounded like abalone to make them tender. P. ostreatus and its Asian counterpart, P. sajor-cajou, are now cultivated commercially and sold fresh under the name ""tree oysters."" "

HABITAT Solitary or in groups or clusters on or near dead conifers (but often appearing terrestrial) in the late spring, summer, and early fall; known only from western North America. Although not common in ost areas, it is very conspicuous because of its large size. I have never seen it at low elevations, but it is often abundant in the Sierra Nevada in the summer on lodgepole pine. I have also collected it on ponderosa pine in the South-west. It produces a brown rot in its host. EDIBILITY Edible and choice, but thorough cooking or parboiling is required because of its toughness. Biologist Bob Winter of Fresno says that it is avidly sought by Japanese-Americans as a shiitake-and matsutake-substitute, perhaps because of its chewy texture. "

HABITAT Scattered to gregarious, often in rings or arcs-in woods, brush, gardens, compost piles, i.e., wherever there is organic debris; widely distributed. It seems to favor cool weather but is common in our area throughout the mushroom season. A favorite abode is in brambles under live oak, often in the company of chanterelles; it is also common under pine and cypress, and I have found it on Ano Nuevo Island in beach grass and elephant seal dung. A single mycelium will produce several crops a year, so check your patches regularly. I know of one fairy ring sixty feet in diameter that produces about 200 blewits each time it fruits! Known as a ""trash inhabitor"" because of its fondness for virtually any type of decomposing organic matter, it can be grown on a wide range of substrates, including shredded newspapers and compost. EDIBILITY Edible and very popular a favorite with beginners and gourmets alike, and one of the most plentiful edible wild mushrooms in our area. It has the dubious distinction of being one of the few purple foods that actually tastes good. It is even popular in fungophobic England and Scotland, where it is sometimes sold in markets. "

It is common along the west coast from Alaska to southern California and fruits in our area from early fall through spring or even summer. It was the single most abundant mushroom on the University of California, Santa Cruz campus (a very ""disturbed"" place!) during the 1976-77 drought. A couple hundred pounds could easily have been harvested. EDIBILITY Edible and quite popular in some regions, but it hardly tastes like chicken as its common name implies. I've found it to be crunchy, but bland. Its abundance and habit of fruiting when other good edibles are scarce make experimentation worthwhile. Be careful, however-this is a species"" complex,"" and some mild cases of poisoning have been attributed to it.

It is partial to conifers in most areas (including the Pacific Northwest), but is locally common in the late fall and winter with live oak, and less commonly pine. EDIBILITY To be avoided, as evidenced by the following severely censored excerpt from an erstwhile colleague's memoirs: ""This common, viscid, red-brown Tricholoma is delicious when stewed slowly with zucchini and served steaming hot on rice with chicken chow mein and white wine. Suffering from an acute attack of overconfidence, M. Henis and C. Cole tried it in this manner one winter evening in order to determine its edibility. They subsequently staggered thrugh an all-night ordeal of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, in which not only the mushroom, but everything else, was expelled. . ."" It is probable, then, that this common, viscid, red-brown Tricholoma is poisonous, although a violent allergic reaction on the part of M. Henis and C. Cole cannot be ruled out entirely. It is suggested that those foolish enough to try it (or any other mushroom of unknown edibility) should do so in extremely small amounts-without the rice, chicken chow mein, and white wine, and by all means, regardless of one's nutritional needs, culinary quirks, or dietary deficiencies, without the zucchini.

HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious on ground in forests, thickets, and pine barrens; found throughout northern North America, but particularly abundant in the Pacific Northwest, where it is harvested commercially. In the mountains of Idaho, Washington, and oregon it is common under mixed conifers and second-growth Douglas-fir, while on the coast it favors sandy pine forests. It also likes to lurk in thickets of ericaceous shrubs (e.g., rhododendron, huckleberry, manzanita), which makes for very difficult collecting. In coastal California, however, it prefers tanoak-madrone stands to conifers, though it also fruits in sandy soil under manzanita with a pine canopy. In our area ""patches"" are hard to find but fairly reliable, producing one crop each year, generally in November or December. EDIBILITY Edible and highly prized by Asian-Americans. In San Francisco and San Jose it sells fresh for as much as $25 a piece! However, its tough, chewy texture does not appeal to everyone.

HABITAT In small or massive clusters on stumps, logs, and living trees, or scattered to gregarious (occasionally solitary) on ground-but growing from roots or buried wood; common on a wide variety of trees and shrubs, and practically worldwide in distribution. In our area it occurs year-round, but is most common in the fall and early winter. I have seen truly stupendous fruitings on oak as. well as walnut (in an orchard) and other trees. It is a virulent parasite of timber, fruit, and garden trees, but can also be a harmless saprophyte on dead trees or on the dead wood (heartwood) ofliving trees. It is called ""oak root fungus"" in California because of its insatiable appetite for oaks, and ..shoe string root rot"" because of the stringy black mycelial strands (rhizomorphs) by which the mycelium spreads. These ..runners"" may extend up the host's trunk or infect neighboring trees by traversing great distances through the soil. on oak trees the mycelium can frequently be seen as whitish fanlike growths between the bark and wood. It generally feeds on the roots and lower trunk of its host, reducing it to a pathetic white, spongy pulp. The mycelium is also thought to be the culprit responsible for the ..aborted"" fruiting bodies of Entoloma abortivum. Actively growing mycelium may phosphoresce at night, giving the wood an eerie luminous aura called ..foxfire."" Inhabitants of subarctic regions are said to mark their trails with bits of glowing wood infected by A. mellea. EDIBILITY Eminently edible. Use only firm caps and discard the tough stalks. It is an abundant food source, crunchy in texture, and a very passable substitute for the shiitake (Lentinus edodes) in stir-fried dishes. The bitter taste cooks out, but some forms are better than others, and some (e.g., those that grow on buckeye or hemlock) can cause digestive upsets. The common name, incidentally, is a reference to its color (which, like honey, is extremely variable), not its taste (which isn't the least bit sweet). "

HABITAT Gregarious in grass, usually in arcs or rings; widely distributed and very common in lawns, parks, cemeteries, etc.; also common in pastures in the Pacific North-west, but rarely straying far from suburbia in our area. Found year-round except during cold spells, but most abundant in California in late spring, summer (on watered lawns), and fall. Several crops are prod uced each year, but its presence can be detected even when it isn't fruiting-just look for ""fairy rings"" (patches of brown grass rimmed by a lush zone of darker green grass). The living mycelium on the periphery ofthe ring stimulates the grass to grow, while the dried-up mycelial matter within the circle inhibits growth. EDIBILITY Delectably delicious-one of the few ""LBM's"" worth learning. What it lacks in substance it makes up for in abundance. Discard the tough stems and use the caps whole. They're superb is just about anything-omelets, soups, sauces, stir-fried dishes, even cookies. or simply saute in butter and serve on toast! What's more, they dry easily, don't decay quickly, and are usually free of maggots. Don't pass up shrivelled, sun-dried specimens-they are easily resurrected or can be stored in an airtight jar for later use. "

In the Rocky Mountains it is abundant in the late summer on aspen; in eastern North America it fruits from the late fall through early spring on elm and other hardwoods. EDIBILITY Edible, but the sticky skin should be removed before cooking. In colder regions it is an important edible and is called the 'winter mushroom"" because it fruits very late in the season (even during winter thaws) when other fungi are not available. In our balmy climate, however, its season coincides with that of other, more flavorful mushrooms, so it is not often gathered.

SPORE_PRINT white; spores 7-12x 6-9 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, smooth, amyloid. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups or troops in woods or on lawns near trees; widely distributed. In our area it is very common under live oak in the fall and early winter and may even turn up in the summer if moisture is sufficient. In the late winter and spring, however, it is largely supplanted by A. ocreata. Perhaps an adventitious (but hardly advantageous!) introduction from Europe, it has taken a fancy to our native oaks and spread like the plague, so that it is now the most abundant Amanita of our live oak woodlands. Heavy fall rains often elicit a stupendous crop-I have counted as many as one hundred specimens under a single oak! I've never seen it growing without live oak in the vicinity, but in southern oregon it grows with other oaks and in eastern North America it has turned up in numerous localities under conifers as well as hard woods. Apparently it can form mycorrhiza with a wide range of hosts! EDIBILITY DEADLY POISONOUS! Learn to recognize this species before eating any mushroom with gills! It is particularly dangerous because the symptoms are delayed, not appearing for from 6 to 24 hours after ingestion, by which time there is relatively little modern medicine can do except to treat the victim symptomatically. In the last decade there have been one or two deaths in California every time a bumper crop has appeared. However, none of the victims were knowledgeable fungophiles, let alone ""mushroom experts"" (as they are often called by the press). The flavor, incidentally, is described by survivors as excellent-despite the awful odor which develops in old specimens. For an account of symptoms and treatment, see pp. 892-893. "

SPORE_PRINT white; spores 9-14 x 7-10 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, smooth, amyloid. Flesh turning bright yellow in KOH (potassium hydroxide). HABITAT Solitary to widely scattered or in small groups on ground under oaks, known from Marin County in California east to the Sierra Nevada foothills and south to Arizona and Texas. In our area it is associated with live oak and is common in the winter and spring, usually after A. phalloides has finished fruiting. It is quite numerous, but doesn't normally produce the huge crops typical of the latter species. Related ""destroying angels"" are abun-dant under hardwoods and conifers in eastern North America, and to a lesser extent, the Pacific Northwest (see comments). EDIBILITY DEADLY POISONOUS! It doesn't enjoy the same notoriety as A. phal-loides, but is just as dangerous, and in some regions (such as southern California), it is the more common of the two. It recently caused several deaths near San Diego. The victims were apparently starving illegal aliens who ate the mushrooms out of desperation. "

In the Pacific Northwest and Sierra Nevada it is perhaps the most omnipresent of all the Amanitas. EDIBILITY Poisonous! It contains the same toxins as A. muscaria, but apparently in higher concentrations-large doses can be fatal! It is said to be one ofthe most common causes of mushroom poisoning in the Pacific Northwest. "

CAP 4-10 (14) cm broad, rounded becoming convex to plane; surface slightly viscid when moist, creamy to pale yellow, golden-yellow, or buff (but see comments), often slightly darker at the center; covered with whitish universal veil remnants (warts) which may merge to form a patch or may disappear in age; margin striate or not. Flesh white, fairly thick. GILLS adnate to adnexed or free, close, white. STALK 5-13 cm long, 0.5-2 cm thick, tapered upward or equal with an enlarged base; dry, white or tinged yellowish, usually smooth above the ring and sometimes scaly below. PARTIAL_VEIL typically present (but absent in var. exannulata), membranous, white; forming a fragile, superior to median, skirtlike ring on stalk, or disappearing. UNIVERSAL_VEIL friable to somewhat cottony, white, usually forming a collarlike volva (free rim) at apex of basal bulb, sometimes also with scaly zones above rim, or sometimes forming a thin sheath instead of a rim, or sometimes the volva more or less indistinct. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 8-13 x 6-9 microns, elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups in woods or along forested paths and roads; widely distributed. In our area it occurs in mixed woods and under live oak shortly after the first fall rains and less commonly thereafter. In the Sierra Nevada and Pacific Northwest it is common under conifers in the springas well as the summer and fall. The mountain form differs slightly from the typical form and may eventually be classified as a separate species. EDIBILITY Poisonous! Some books list it as edible, but other sources say it contains the same toxins as A. pantherina and A. muscaria. "

CAP 5-30 (40) cm broad, round becoming convex and finally plane or slightly depressed; surface viscid when moist, color variable: bright red to blood-red, scarlet-red, or orange-red when fresh (var. muscaria and var. flavivolvata), but often fading to orange, yellow-orange, or paler; bright yellow-orange to yellow, then fading (var.formosa); yellow with a peachy center (var. persicina); or white to buff to silvery-grayish-white(var. alba); covered at first with a dense coating of universal veil fragments (warts) which are usually white(but are yellow in var. flavivolvata and often buff or tan in var. alba); warts flattened in age, often wearing away or washed off by rain; margin usually at least somewhat striate. Flesh firm when young, soft inage; thick, white. GILLS adnate to adnexed or free, close, broad, white. STALK 5-20 (30) cm long, 1-3 (4) cm thick at apex, tapering upward or equal with a basal bulb up to 6 cm broad; white or whitish, or somewhat discolored in age; smooth or somewhat ragged-scaly below the ring; often fragile in old age. PARTIAL_VEIL membranous, usually forming a thin, persistent, median to superior, skirtlike ring on stalk which may collapse in age; ring white or with yellow patches, margin often torn or toothed. UNIVERSAL_VEIL friable, forming a scaly volva at apex of bulb consisting of one or more (usually 24) concentric rings. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 9-13 x 6.5-9 microns, broadly elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Solitary or scattered to densely gregarious or in large rings in forests and at their edges, also with planted trees. Common throughout most of the northern hemisphere-its fa vorite mycorrhizal mates include pine, spruce, fir, birch, and aspen. The bright red form with white warts (vaL muscaria) is the common one in western North America as well as Europe and Asia. In our area it fruits along with the yellow-warted variety from fall to early spring and is often abundant in our coastal pine forests and along freeways where pines have been planted. It also turns up occasionally under oak and madrone. In the Rocky Mountains it is common in late summer with spruce and in the Pacific Northwest in the fall with various conifers. The red-capped form with yellow warts (vaL j7avivolvala) has a southern distribution but is quite common in our area. The form with a bright yellow to yellow-orange cap (vaLjurmu:m) is the dominant one in eastern North America. In California it iscommonin the Sierra Nevada but ratherrarein the Coast ranges. The grayish-white form (var. alba) is more common in northern regions. It has been found in northern California, but is rare. The peach-centered variety (var. persicina) is most common in the Southeast. It is interesting to note that wherever A. muscaria grows it is often accompanied by Boletus edulis. and can serve as a ""red flag"" indicator for that species. I've even seen a very large ring of A. muscaria locally that numbered over 100 fruiting bodies, with three bulky B. edulis growing right in the middle of it! EDIBILITY Poisonous and hallucinogenic-esteemed by both maggots and mystics. Fatalities are extremely rare, but it is undoubtedly dangerous in large or even moderate amounts. The effects vary from person to person, mushroom to mushroom, and from region to region and season to season, so that there is no way to determine in advance what one's reaction will be. Too many people have had unpleasant experiences for me to recommend it (for an account of its effects, see p. 894). Tales of ""getting off' by nibbling on a piece of the veil or licking the ""stars"" off the cap are frivolous. However, the skin ap-parently contains greater concentrations of the toxins than the rest of the fruiting body. The name ..fly agaric,"" incidentally, is derived from the ancient practice of using the mush-room (often mixed with milk) to stupefy flies. It is also notable for its ability to concentrate vanadium-a rare, malleable, ductile metal used to add tensile strength to steel-from the soil. "

CAP 7-20 (25) cm broad, nearly oval to convex, becoming broadly convex or plane; surface slightly viscid when moist, smooth, or sometimes with one or two pieces of thick white universal veil tissue; bright red to orange-red or orange, often fading to yellowish or even paler in sunlight or heavy rain; margin conspicuously striate. Flesh thick, yellow under the cuticle, otherwise white. GILLS close, broad, adnate to adnexed or free, bright chrome-yellow or at times egg-yellow, or pale yellow with darker yellow edges. STALK 5-15 (20) cm long, 1.5-3 cm thick, equal or slightly thicker below (but may appear bulbous from the thick volva); smooth or with small scales, same color as gills or slightly paler; stuffed with a pith or jelly, eventually hollow. PARTIAL_VEIL membranous, forming a persistent, superior and often striate, skirtlike ring which is colored like the gills. UNIVERSAL_VEIL thick, membranous, white, forming a large, rather tough, lobed, saclike volva which is attached only to the base of stalk and may have a flange within. SPORE_PRINT white or faintly yellow; spores 8-12x 6-8 microns, elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious or sometimes in large rings, in pine and oak woods in southern Europe and much ofthe warm temperate zone. Its North American distribution parallels that of Lactarius indigo: it is common in the summer under ponderosa pine in Arizona and New Mexico, as well as with various pines in Mexico and Central America, and a slightly different variety (see comments) occurs in the southeastern United States north to Quebec. It has not been recorded from California but is to be looked for in the warmer parts of the state (it is apparently supplanted by A. calyptrata). I have seen enormous fruitings near the Grand Canyon, in August and September. EDIBILITY Edible and highly prized in Europe, where it is considered among the very best of all mushrooms (it is said to have been a favorite of the Caesars). In America, however, it is not so highly regarded. Its flavor is very similar to that of A. calyptrata, which is to say, not to everyone's liking. Because of its brilliant color it is by far the safest ofthe Amanitas for the table (but not necessarily the best-see A. velosal). "

CAP 7-25 cm or more broad, rounded becoming convex and finally plane; surface viscid when wet, usually with a large, thick, central, cottony whitish patch of universal veil tissue; otherwise typically dull orange to orange-brown, bronze, yellow-brown, or dark brown, usually with a paler (yellow) margin, or pale yellow to creamy or whitish (the pale form) or occasionally greenish; margin usually clearly striate. Flesh firm, thick, white or creamy; odor mild becoming slightly unpleasant in age. GILLS broad, close, adnate becoming adnexed or free, white to pale creamy-yellow. STALK 7-25 cmlong, 1-3.5 cm thick, equal or tapering upward, smooth, creamy to yellowish (typical form) or creamy to white (pale form) or white to greenish (greenish form); hollow, the cavity often filled with a cottony or jellylike substance. PARTIAL_VEIL membranous, colored like stalk or slightly darker, forming a large but fragile, superior, skirt like ring on stalk which is easily obliterated. UNIVERSAL_VEIL membranous, white, forming a large saclike volva that sheathes the stalk base; volva thick, ample, felty or cottony, often lobed, often with a collar or flange within. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 8-11 x 5-6 microns, elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Solitary to widely scattered or gregarious on ground in woods; known only from the west coast. The distribution of the typical (darker) form parallels that of its favorite mycorrhizal mate, madrone: it is common in northern California and southern oregon, where madrone is also common, less frequent in Washington, where madrone is likewise less numerous, then common again on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, where madrone is abundant. In our area it usually fruits after the first fall rains, sometimes in tremendous quantity. The pale form, on the other hand, is a late winter and spring mushroom. In our area it favors oak, but never fruits in the large quantities characteristic of the fall (typical) form. In the Sierra Nevada the pale form is prevalent under pine and other conifers, often forming ""mushrumps"" (especially in the spring). EDIBILITY Edible and popular, but with a rather strong, fishy fla vor tha t doesn't appeal to everyone. Too many people eat and enjoy the typical form for me not to recommend it. However, be absolutely sure of your identification, review the comments on pp. 264-265, and avoid the pale and greenish forms, which are easily confused with poisonous species (see photo on next page!). The caps are superb stuffed and then broiled. The hollow stems can be sliced crosswise(to make rings) and marinated. The flesh does not keep well, so use what you pick as soon as possible. Italian-Americans stalk it with a passion, undoubtedly because of its resemblance-in both appearance and flavor-to their beloved A. caesarea of Italy. ""Coccora,"" ""coccoli,"" and ""cocconi"" (another nickname) are presumably derived from an Italian word for cocoon-a very apt description ofthe large, soft, cottony ""eggs."" "

PARTIAL_VEIL usually absent, but a rudimentary ring (annulus) sometimes present as a cottony or fibrillose-scaly zone. UNIVERSAL_VEIL membranous, forming a saclike volva which sheathes the stalk base; volva white or tinged cap color, usually buried, ample but sometimes disintegrating or obscure. SPORE_PRINT white or tinged very slightly pinkish; spores 8.5-12.5 x 6-10 microns, nearly round to elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious, common in winter and spring, associated in our area with live oak but often growing out in the open(in fields and around their edges, brushy areas, lawns, etc.), up to 40 feet away from its mycorrhizal host (which is often stunted by poor soil conditions). It also occurs in the aspen-conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada and with various oaks in the Sierra Nevada foothills and southern oregon. It is apparently endemic to the west coast and more common in our area than anywhere else. With A. rubescens and A. ocreala it forms a striking triumvirate of springtime Amanitas that are monogamous locally with live oak. It is interesting to note that when all three form mycorrhiza with the same tree, they frequently occupy distinctly different zones or niches: A. velosa typically grows in the open at the outer fringes of the host's roots; A. ocreala grows in deep shade near the trunk; and A. rubescens occupies the intermediate zone or ""shade border"" near the perimeter of the branche. EDIBILITY Edible and incredible! Most ""objective"" fungophiles rate it far superior to the better-known A. calyplrala and A. caesarea. At any rate, it is far sweeter. As a bonus, it fruits in the spring when there is a paucity of other collectable delectables. However, it is nol a good choice for beginners.

SPORE_PRINT chocolate-brown; spores 6.5-8.5 x 4-5.5 microns, elliptical, smooth. Cap surface not yellowing in KOH. Basidia mostly 4-spored. HABITAT As its name implies (campestre=field), this is a grassland species, occurring throughout the world from sea level to above timberline. It usually grows in groups or rings in lawns, pastures and meadows, cemeteries, golf courses, baseball fields, etc., but can also be solitary. It fruits practically year-round in our area, but is most abundant in the fall and early winter, when stupendous crops are sometimes produced in our pastures. Thou-sands of pounds, in fact, go unpicked every year. Though they can often be seen from the road, fungophobic Americans drive right by them, some undoubtedly on the way to the store to buy mushrooms! EDIBILITY Edible and excellent, both raw and cooked. It is the most widely picked mushroom in English-speaking countries (where it is also known as the ""pink-bottom""), and is the popular champignon of France. Those who equate it with the cultivated mush-room (A. bisporus) do it an injustice. Its flavor islar superior, though the texture is softer.

HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in grou,ps or rows on road shoulders, in hard-packed soil, along sidewalks, around playgrounds, and in other disturbed areas; often fruiting underground (looking for them can be like digging for clams!). Widely distributed but not common on the coast, where it is largely replaced by A. bernardii. I have heard of gigantic fruiting bodies (10 inch buttons!) of either this species or A. bernardii buried deep in alluvial soil in riverbeds in the Livermore-Pleasanton area of California. In colder regions A. bitorquis often appears along roads where salt is sprayed in the winter. In the Southwest it is often abundant along highways, but is hard to spot because of its subter-ranean habit. However, shaggy manes (Coprinus comatus), which are hard not to spot, are often an indicator of its pres,ence.ln our area I have found it in the fall, winter, and spring. EDIBILITY Edible, and in my fickle fungal opinion, the best of all Agaricus species. In Europe it is cultivated commercially because of its immunity to the virus disease that plagues A. bisporus. It is larger, meatier, and much firmer than either A. bisporus or A. campestris. one devotee goes so far as to say: ""Life is like an Agaricus bitorquis-all good except for a few gills.""

I have seen it fruit by the hundreds in manure-filled trenches on a berry farm near Watsonville, California, in the late spring, summer, and early fall (sometimes accom-panied by Lepiota lutea and L. americana). It is easily grown at home in a vegetable garden (if you use compost) and mycelium from thejust-described ""patch"" is now being marketed for this purpose. It has the advantage ofliking it hot, meaning you can enjoy it at the same time as your other summer vegetables (A. bisporus is also grown easily in gardens, but likes it much cooler). EDIBILITY Edible (for most people) and delicious! The almondy odor and taste is much stronger than that of A. augustus-so strong, in fact, that some people don't care for it. I put several specimens in a cream-of-mushroom soup and those who tasted it swore I had dumped in a bottle of almond extract! It was apparently cultivated around the turn of the century, but lost out to A. bisporus-which raises an interesting prospect: if it had become the ""cultivated mushroom"" instead of A. bisporus, would the word ""mushroomy"" have a completely different (sweet and almondy) connotation?

It shows a definite preference for warm weather, fruiting in the spring, summer, and fall-or in the winter if it's mild enough. Several crops are prod uced each year, so visit your patches regularly. It is curious that such a large mushroom requires so little moisture to fruit-a little fogdrip is all it needs! EDIBILITY Edible (for most people) and one of the very best! It's especially significant beca use it fruits in the spring and summer, when edible fungi are scarce in our area.

CAP 2-8 cm high andlor broad, round or oval and often somewhat lobed when young, becoming conical to bell-shaped, or in old age convex; deliquescing from the margin toward the center; surface dry, smooth or with silky whitish fibrils (universal veil tissue) when young, grayish-brown to grayish-tan when young (the center often browner or with small brown scales and the margin sometimes pallid), becoming lead-gray to inky-gray in age; margin striate or grooved, usually tattered OI splitting in age. Flesh thin, soft, pallid or grayish. GILLS free or nearly free, crowded, at first white, soon gray or with pinkish to vinaceous tints, finally black and deliquescing (becoming inky). STALK 4-15 (20) cm long, 0.6-1.5 cm thick, equal or with a narrowed or enlarged base; white or with grayish to brownish fibrils below; hollow. PARTIAL_VEIL fibrillose and evanescent or leaving a median to basal ring or ridged zone on stalk, or sometimes even a rudimentary volva near base, SPORE_PRINT black; spores 7-12 x 4 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious or in massive clumps in cultivated areas, lawns, gardens, roadsides, around or on old stumps, etc., sometimes also in the woods; widely distributed and very common, fruiting in our area practically year-round. It used to be an unwanted intruder in cultivated mushroom beds, and is one of our characteristic ""suburban"" mushrooms. The largest fruiting I've seen in the wild was under aspen in New Mexico. Several crops are generally produced each year. EDIBILITY Edible when young and fairly good-but sometimes reacting with alcohol in the body to produce a peculiar type of poisoning (see p. 896 for details). The grayish-brown caps look rather unappetizing-and precisely for this reason were the very first wild mushroom I ventured to eat. Inky cap-and-salami sandwhiches became a staple item in my teen-age diet until I discovered finer and more flavorful fungal foods, such as ""s parassis Sole"" and .. Agaricus Elegante."" "

Common_Name: Mica Cap; Glistening Inky Cap
Group?: No
CAP 2-4 cm high when young, 1.5-5 cm broad when expanded; at first oval, soon bell-shaped, then expanding to convex; surface sprinkled at first with minute glistening whitish particles (universal veil remnants) which often disappear in age, otherwise tan to yellow-brown to ochre, buff, fulvous, or cinnamon-brown (margin often paler), becoming grayer in age, especially toward margin; striate at least half way to center, the margin usually tattered or split at maturity. Flesh thin, pallid or white, soft. GILLS crowded, adnate to adnexed or free, palllid soon becoming gray or brownish, finally black; deliquescing (sometimes partially, sometimes completely). STALK 3-8 (12) cm long, 2-6 mm thick, more or less equal, fragile, hollow, smooth, white or discoloring buff. PARTIAL_VEIL absent or rudimentary, but stalk sometimes with a slight basal ring (presumably formed by the universal veil). SPORE_PRINT dark brown to black; spores 7-11 x 4-6 microns, elliptical but often compressed (flattened) somewhat, smooth. HABITAT Gregarious, usually in clusters, on wood or woody debris, around stumps, or on roots or buried wood (thus appearing terrestrial); widely distributed and very common. It fruits practically year-round in our area. Like C. atramentarius, it is a common feature of suburbia but also occurs in the woods (on cottonwood, oak, alder, etc.). EDIBILITY Edible, but thin-fleshed and watery. The flavor is said to be good, however, and since it often occurs in large numbers, it is easy to gather enough for a meal. It does not always digest itself completely, another point in its favor. "

STALK 3-8 cm long, 2-6 (8) mm thick, equal or with an enlarged base, sometimes curved; dry, whitish, but staining blue to bluish-green when handled or bruised. VEIL fibrillose or cobwebby, copious but disappearing or at most forming a very slight ring or hairy zone on stalk. SPORE_PRINT purple-brown to purple-gray or purple-black; spores 9-12 x 5-9 microns, elliptical, smooth. Chrysocystidia absent on gills. HABITAT Widely scattered to densely gregarious on wood chips, sawdust, mulch, and humus, and on lawns rich in lignin; partial to coniferous debris, but also fond of alder and eucalyptus. It is fairly common in the San Francisco Bay area in cold weather (December-February), especially in landscaped areas and mulched flower beds, and is also fairly common in oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. It is easily cultivated, and its aggressive mycelium responds readily to transplanting-given the proper conditions. EDIBILITY Hallucinogenic (see p. 895) and extremely potent, especially ra w. Along with P. baeocystis and P. stricti pes (see comments), it is the most powerful known hallucino-genic mushroom in the north temperate zone. only one or two caps are needed to induce marked changes in perception and sensation. Psilocin is primarily responsible, with psilocybin and possibly other compounds contributing to the effects. Together they are said toconstituteO.6olo ofthe mushroom on a dry weight basis-substantially more than the better known P. cubensis. A six-year-old Washington boydied£!fteringestingan unknown quantity of P. baeocyslis along with other unidentified mushrooms However, effects on adults other than those typical of psilocybin-and psilocin-ingestion have not been reported.

Common_Name: Stuntz's Blue Legs
Group?: No
CAP 1-4 (5) cm broad, bluntly conical becoming convex to broadly umbonate, plane, or with an uplifted margin in age; surface smooth, viscid when moist, color variable: deep olive-brown to chestnut-brown when young, but often fading as it ages or dries to dingy yellow-brown or yellowish-buff; margin striate when moist and often tinged greenish. Flesh thin, pallid to brownish. GILLS adnate or adnexed, pallid soon becoming grayish or brownish; close or fairly well-spaced. STALK 2-6 cm long, 1.5-4 mm thick, equal or thicker at either end, often curved, yellowish to brown or sometimes with darker or bluish stains, especially below; not viscid, often with mycelial threads at base. VEIL membranous but thin; forming a fragile ring or fibrillose zone on stalk which is often blue or bluish-green but eventually may be darkened by falling spores or may disappear. SPORE_PRINT dark purple-brown; spores 8-12 x 6-8 microns, elliptical, smooth. Chrysocystidia absent on gills. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious or clustered on wood chips, mulch, etc., in lawns, gardens, and landscaped areas; also under conifers and in fields. It is known only from the west coast and is especially common in the Puget Sound region of Washington in the fall, early winter, and spring. (The appearance of large numbers in wood chip mulch on the University of Washington campus in Seattle more than a decade ago helped spur the ""magic mushroom"" craze that subsequently swept the Pacific Northwest.) In our area I have found it in mulched flower pots. EDIBILITY Weakly hallucinogenic (see p. 895), but popular with ""magic mushroom"" hunters because it often fruits in large numbers. Be sure not to confuse it with deadly Galerina species, which can look quite similar, but have rusty-brown spores-they will even grow intermixed with P. stuntzii! "

Common_Name: Magic Mushroom
Group?: No
CAP 1.5-8 (10) cm broad, broadly conical or oval or bell-shaped (often with an umbo) when young, gradually expanding to convex, broadly umbonate, or plane; surface smooth or with small whitish veil remnants when young, viscid when moist, soon dry, color variable: whitish with a brown to yellowish center, or entirely yellow to yellowish-buff to yellow-brown, or sometimes cinnamon-brown when young and sometimes dingy olive in old age; bruising and aging bluish; margin sometimes hung with veil remnants. Flesh firm, white, staining blue or blue-green when bruised. GILLS close, adnate to adnexed or seceding to free; pallid, soon becoming gray, then deep purple-gray to nearly black; edges whitish. STALK 4-15 cm long, 0.4-1.5 cm thick, equal or more often thicker below, dry, white or sometimes yellowish to yellow-brown, aging or bruising blue or blue-green; smooth. VEIL membranous, white or bluish-stained, usually forming a thin, fragile, superior ring on stalk which is blackened by falling spores. SPORE_PRINT dark purple-brown to blackish; spores 11-17 x 7-12 microns, elliptical, smooth, thick-walled, with a large apical germ pore. Cystidia present on faces of gills, but chrysocystidia absent. HABITAT Solitary or in groups on dung and manure, especially in cattle pastures; widely distributed in the tropics and subtropics-Colombia, Central America, Mexico, etc.-and in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Since it is being cultivated on a widespread basis, it may eventually turn up in the warmer parts of California-as it did in Santa Cruz during muggy summer weather (on compost from a ""magic mushroom"" farm). It can be cultivated on a variety of simple grain or compost mediums, but strict temperature control and sterile conditions are necessary to induce growth and prevent contamination. EDIBILITY Hallucinogenic (see p. 895). It is not as powerful on a dry weight basis as P. cyanescens, but is larger. At one time the demand for ""magic mushrooms"" far out-stripped the supply, with the result that many of the ""psilocybin"" mushrooms sold on the street were actually grocery store mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus ) laced with LS D or other substances (one sample I examined proved to be a soggy chanterelle soaked in ammonia!). Now that cultivation procedures have been refined, you're much more likely to get the real thing. It is often sold dried, though drying decreases the potency. The mycelium is also ""active."" Ironically, natives of Oaxaca, Mexico, consider this species inferior to others, such as P. mexicana (perhaps because it was unknown to them until the Spaniards intro-duced cattle). Instead of using it themselves, they sell it to eager gringos! "

Group?: Yes
CAP 3-12 cm broad, convex or broadly bell-shaped becoming broadly umbonate to plane or with an uplifted margin; surface smooth or in age sometimes wrinkled, viscid to ex-tremely slimy when moist, at first lavender or violet, but fading quickly or slowly (often from center outward) to yellowish, brownish-ochre, tawny, brown, or paler. Flesh rather thin, violet-tinged becoming whitish; taste mild. GILLS at first lavender or grayish-lavender, soon grayish or grayish-cinnamon with whitish, finely scalloped edges. finally rusty-cinnamon; adnate to adnexed or notched, close. STALK 5-15 cm long, 1-2.5 (3) cm thick, equal or at times spindle-shaped when young (swollen slightly in the middle); viscid or slimy throughout or at least over lower portion; violet to silvery-violet or lavender in part or throughout, but often fading somewhat (like cap) in age; smooth or with whitish to violet scales above. UNIVERSAL_VEIL slimy, violet, forming a slime sheath on stalk. CORTINA obscured by slime, evanescent or leaving a few hairs on stalk. SPORE_PRINT dark cinnamon-brown; spores 12-17 x 5.5-8 microns, elliptical, roughened. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious in woods; widely distributed and locally abundant (along with similar species) in the late fall and winter. Like C. balteatus, it tends to fruit with ericaceous shrubs and trees, e.g., manzanita, madrone, andlor huckleberry. EDIBILITY Better eyed than fried; the snotlike universal veil will deter most. "

CAP 3.5-12 (I5) cm broad, convex becoming broadly convex, broadly umbonate, or plane; surface dry, densely covered with minute erect, tufted hairs or small scales, giving it a rough, somewhat velvety appearance; deep violet to nearly black, often with a metallic luster in age; margin often somewhat paler and fringed or ragged. Flesh thick, deep violet becoming grayish-violet; odor mild or cedarlike. GILLS adnate becoming adnexed or notched, fairly well-spaced, deep violet or colored like cap, then dusted with cinnamon-brown spores. STALK 6-18 cm long, 1-2.5 cm thick at apex, equal or more often thicker below, dry, fibrillose or woolly, deep violet, solid, firm. CORTINA violet, soon disappearing or leaving a few indistinct hairs near top of stalk which may catch falling spores. SPORE_PRINT rusty-brown; spores 13-17 x 7-10 microns, broadly elliptical to oblong, roughened. Cystidia present on both the faces and edges of the gills. HABITAT Solitary or in twos and threes under conifers, sometimes next to rotting logs; widely distributed but quite rare except in certain localities, such as the old-growth coniferous forests of M 1. Rainier and Olympic national parks in Washington. In our area it shows up occasionally in the late fall and winter in mixed woods; in northern California it is sometimes quite common under Sitka spruce; in Europe it is said to favor hardwoods.

"Genus: Agrocybe
Species: praecox
Common_Name: Spring Agrocybe; Early Agrocybe
Group?: Yes
CAP(2)3-10 cm or more broad, convex or broadly umbonate to plane, orat times with an uplifted margin in age; surface dry or slightly tacky, smooth or in age sometimes cracked or fissured; creamy to creamy-ochre, yellow-brown, tan, hazel-brown, or olive-brown; margin often with veil remnants, not striate. Flesh white or pale ochre, soft; odor mild to farinaceous; taste mild or more often somewhat bitter to farinaceous. GILLS close, broad, adnate but often seceding; at first pallid, then light brown to grayish, finally dull brown or ochre-brown. STALK 3-13 cm long, 0.3-1 or more cm thick, equal or tapered below (or occasionally enlarged below), white or pallid, but often brownish-stained below in age; fibrillose-striate, the base usually with white mycelial threads. VEIL membranous but thin; forming a fragile, superior, skirtlike ring on stalk or leaving remnants on cap margin or gills or disappearing entirely. SPORE_PRINT rich brown (""cigar-brown""); spores 8-12x 5-7 microns, elliptical, smooth, truncate from the apical germ pore. Cap cuticle cellular. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious in grassy or cultivated areas, along roads, in wood chips, gardens, woods, etc.; widely distributed, fruiting mainly in the spring. In our area this species ""complex"" is among the very common early spring mushrooms mush-rooms (February-April), but occurs at other times also. The largest fruitings I've seen were in iceplant along a freeway offramp and on a parkway mulched with wood chips. It also occurs fairly commonly under mountain conifers in the spring. EDIBILITY Edible, but not recommended. The taste is mediocre at best, disgusting at worst, and there are a number of variants in this group whose edibility is unknown. "

In our area I ha ve found it only once, on a la wn in October, but a large number of fruiting bodies were present. EDIBILITY POISONOUS-potentially fatal! It will not tempt most mushroom hunters because of its small size, but is dangerous to toddlers in the so-called ""grazing stage,"" particularly because it grows on lawns. Analysis has revealed the presence of amanita-toxins, and 20-30 caps are equivalent to about half of one cap of Amanita phalloides-a compelling reason not to eat ""LBM's!"" "

Flesh thick, firm, pale buff to yellowish, but usually staining reddish to brown when cut. GILLS usually decurrent, close or crowded, pallid to pale yellowish becoming dingy yellow to olive, brownish, or yellow-brown, staining dark brown or reddish-brown when bruised or in old age; often forking andlor forming pores near the stalk. STALK 2-7 (10) cm long, 0.5-4 cm thick, usually shorter than width of mature cap, equal or tapered at either end, central to somewhat off-center, solid, firm, dry, smooth; colored like ca p or paler, often with dingy reddish to dark brown stains. SPORE_PRINT brown to yellow-brown; spores 7-10 x 4-6 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Usually scattered to densely gregarious on ground in woods, around the edges of bogs, and in tree-studded parks or lawns; widely distributed, and by far the most common member of the genus. Two possibly distinct forms occur in our area: the typical one (shown in photo at bottom of p. 477) fruits mainly with planted birch trees in the fall, while a larger form occurs with oak and pine in the late fall and winter. EDIBILITY Dangerous! It is often eaten in Europe and by transplanted Europeans in America, but it can cause hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) and kidney failure if eaten raw, and sometimes even when thoroughly cooked! (A pparently the human body can develop a devastating sensitivity to it.) It often has a sour taste anyway, soitis best avoided and should never be eaten raw. The one recorded instance of a bonafide mycologist dying of mushroom-poisoning was attributed to this fungus! "

HABITAT Solitary to scattered or gregarious on ground under conifers, particularly pine; widely distri buted, but especially common in northern and western North America. Along with C. rutilus (see comments), it is a prominent fungal facet of our pine forests and is also frequent in yards and lawns where pines have been planted. The major crop is usually in the late fall or winter and is often accompanied by masses of mushy slippery jacks (Suillus species), but it can be found most any time. It is quite sporadic in its fruiting habits-overwhelmingly abundant some years, very sparse during others.

It is most abundant in the fall and winter but can be found whenever it's damp enough. It is also quite common under knobcone and ponderosa pines-but apparently only within the geographical range of Monterey pine.

It is often abundant in our coastal pme forests in the fall and winter(usually 2-4 weeks after the first substantial fall rains) as well as under oak, and a smaller flush may appear in the spring. In coastal northern California and oregon it grows with pine and spruce in the fall; in the Sierra Nevada a stout form fruits in large quantities under conifers in the spring, summer, and fall; and in the high Rockies the variety with a dark red cap fruits in colossal quantities in August and September, under spruce. EDIBILITY one of the finest offleshy fungi and certainly the best-loved and most sought-after in Europe, where it has more common names than there are languages. If any mushroom deserves the dubious title of ""king,"" this is the one. It is a consummate crea-tion, the peerless epitome of earthbound substance, a bald bulbous pillar of thick white flesh-the one aristocrat the peasantry can eat! The entire fruiting body is exceptionally delicious, even the tubes ifthey're firm enough. It is delicious raw, but can cause stomach upsets because it's difficult to digest, so play it safe and cook it (preferably on high heat in an open pan, so as to drive off the excess mois-ture). The odor and taste of dried B. edulis are marvelous-nutty, earthy, and meaty all at once. But you have to find them before you can eat them. and it isn't always easy. You can't just casually look for them the way you can forchanterelles or blewits-you have to hunt them down and root them up from under the duff before they're visible to others. Timing is of paramount importance, because you face formidable competition from both maggots and boletivores(see p. 546). one source suggests getting up at the crack of dawn and wearing your shirt inside out. Uthatdoesn't work, you can always resort to the dried, imported version found in delicatessens. "

CAP (5) 7-20 (30) cm broad, rounded becoming convex and then broadly convex to plane or somewhat irregular; surface viscid when moist, practically smooth but usually with flattened fibrils, sometimes pitted in age; dark red to reddish-brown, or at times rusty-brown, rusty-orange, or brown (see comments); margin with flaps of sterile tissue when young, which break up into segments or disappear in age. Flesh thick, firm becoming soft at maturity, white, usually bruising smoky-gray to purple-gray or bluish-gray when cut, but often very slowly or only in certain areas. PORES and tubes whitish to pale olive, olive-gray, or grayish, usually deep dingy olive-buff in age; not blueing when bruised but often discoloring brown. STALK 8-20 cm long, 1.5-4 cm thick at apex, equal or often thicker or swollen below, tough, fibrous, solid, white or whitish when fresh, but roughened by numerous small projecting scabers that are pallid at first but deep brown to black by maturity; lower portion often bruising (or already stained) bright blue to greenish-blue. SPORE_PRINT brown; spores 13-19 x 3-5 microns, spindle-shaped to elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Solitary to widely scattered or gregarious on ground, associated with man-zanita and madrone but often growing in mixed woods; known only from the west coast. It is common in our area in the fall and winter and is easily the most prevalent Leccinum in coastal California. It is seldom as prolific as B. edulis, but 1 have seen more than fifty prime fructifications under a patch of stunted madrones in the middle of a pasture. EDIBILITY Edible and esteemed by many boletivores, but disappointingly bland in my experience. Mature or waterlogged specimens should be dried in order to concentrate their flavor and get rid of excess moisture. In one blind tasting of several local boletes (all fresh), it placed next to last-slightly behind the boring Boletus subtomentosus but ahead of the abominable Suillusfuscotomentosus. Michael Cabaniss, who did the line drawings for this book, says: ""I have tried only dried slices, a form which is not the most visually stimulating. . . their consistency is rather grainy, giving the gustatory experience of dried earth or decomposed redwood chips. Dried slices are not even chewy; they break up readily when inserted into the oral cavity and are swallowed with great difficulty."" "

Group?: No
CAP (4) 6-17 cm broad, round to convex becoming broadly convex to nearly plane; surface dry or only slightly viscid when wet, smooth to minutely fibrillose or sometimes breaking up into small scales, in age sometimes pitted; color variable: bright orange to rusty-orange, reddish-orange, orange-brown, reddish-brown, or cinnamon (or in one form brown), often paler or duller (tan, brown, or dull orange-brown) in age; margin usually with flaps of sterile tissue, at least when young. Flesh thick, often rather soft in age, white, turning bluish-gray to purple-gray or fuscous when bruised or cut, but sometimes very slowly or erratically. PORES and tubes pallid or whitish when young, becoming olive-buff to grayish or dull yellowish-buff in age; not blueing when bruised (but may stain yellowish to brown, lavender, or vinaceous). STALK 6-15 cm long, 1-2.5 cm thick at apex, equal or swollen below, dry, solid, rather tough and fibrous; white or whitish when fresh, but roughened by numerous small, projecting scabers which are initially pallid but become reddish-orange to brown and finally blackish by maturity; base or lower portion often staining or discoloring blue. SPORE_PRINT brown to yellow-brown; spores 11-18x 4-6 microns, spindle-shaped to elongated-elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious or in troops on ground in woods and at their edges; associated primarily if not exclusively with aspen, and common in the summer and early fall wherever aspen occurs. It is abundant in the Sierra Nevada (along with other Leccinums-see comments), and I have seen enormous fruitings in the Southwest and Rocky Mountains shortly after the blue columbines bloom. It is also abundant in Alaska. EDIBILITY Edible and good. Though not the equal of Boletus edulis. it is far better in flavor than its coastal counterpart, L. manzanitae. Like most Leccinums it darkens when cooked or dried. If this intimidates you, that's fine with me-I'll be more than happy to take them off your hands! "

FRUITING_BODY annual, at first knoblike, then cushion-or shelf-like juicy when fresh, soft to fairly firm. CAP 7-30 cm broad and 2-6cm thick when mature, tongue-shaped or fan-shaped surface minutely roughened and suedelike or velvety, but often gelatinous when wet, firm or very soft and spongy, sometimes knobby orange-buff to reddish-orange to pinkish, reddish-brown, dark red, or liver-colored margin often lobed. Flesh thick, soft and watery when fresh and oozing with 4ark reddish juice whitish to grayish, olive-brown, or reddish, streaked or marbled horizontally with paler veins (usually reddening after standing) taste rather sour or strongly acidic. PO RES 1-3 per mm. circular, whitish to yellowish, buff, or pale flesh-color, becoming dark reddish-brown when bruised or in old age tubes 10-15 mm long, closely packed but discrete (their walls not joined). STALK absent, or if present then lateral and rather short, 2-6 (10) cm long, 1-4 cm thick tougher than the cap but continous with it and colored similarly, firm. SPORE_PRINT pinkish-salmon to pale ochre or pale rusty-brown; spores 4-6 x 3-4 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Solitary or sometimes several together at the bases of hardwoods and on stumps, especially of chestnut and oak; widely distributed, but most common in Europe and eastern North America. In coastal California it seems to grow exclusively onchinqua-pin (a close relative of chestnut) in the fall and winter. In my experience it is not common, but Chroogomphus-king Ciro Milazzo discovered one large local fruiting of over thirty individuals on some recently cut chinquapin stumps. It causes a serious carbonizing decay in its host. The rich brown hue it imparts to the wood is prized by cabinetmakers. EDIBILITY Edible. The strong sour taste is displeasing to some, esteemed by others. Parboiling may remove some of the sourness as well as some of the nutrients (it is rich in vitamin C). I like to marinate thin, raw slices in seasoned vinegar and olive oil. "

CAP 5-20 (30) cm broad and 2-10 cm thick, convex or plane; surface at first densely covered with stiff or bristly hairs, the hairs tending to wear away in age; bright reddish-orange to yellowish-brown to rusty-yellow when fresh, becoming brown to dark reddish-brown or even blackish in age. Flesh up to 5 (10) cm thick, at first watery or spongy(but fibrous), tougher in age; rusty to rusty-yellow to dark reddish-brown; odor often rather pleasant when fresh. PORES 1-3 (4) per mm, yellowish to brown or rusty-yellow, sometimes with an olive tinge and sometimes beaded with droplets, darkening with age or where bruised; tubes 0.5-3 cm long. STALK absent. SPORE_PRINT ochre-to chestnut-brown; spores 7 .5-11 x 6-9 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, smooth. Flesh darkening (staining red to black) in KOH. HABITAT Usually solitary (occasionally several) on living or recently dead hard woods or rarely conifers; fruiting mostly in the summer and fall but occurring year-round, widely distributed. It is a destructive parasite of oak and walnut (causing a white rot of the heart-wood), but occurs on a wide range of other trees, including mulberry and willow. The fruiting bodies usually emerge from the wounds of trees, often at a considerable distance from the ground. I have not seen this species locally but it occurs in southern California.

"Genus: Inonotus
Species: tomentosus
Common_Name: N/A
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY usually terrestrial with a cap and a short or rudimentary stalk, but sometimes lacking a stalk and growing shelf-like on wood. CAP 3-12 (18) cm broad, circular to fan-shaped in outline, convex to plane to centrally depressed; surface dry, soft and hairy (tomentose) or velvety, whitish when very young but soon yellowish-brown to tan, dull ochre, brown, or rusty-brown, sometimes with faint concentric zones. Flesh yellow-brown to brown, duplex: upper layer soft and spongy when fresh, lower layer rather thin, firm, and fibrous. PORES round to angular or irregular becoming torn or sometimes toothlike in age, 24 per mm, pale buff to grayish or beige or becoming brownish, but often with a hoary sheen or surface covering; darker brown where bruised; tubes 1.5-7 mm long, usually decurrent. STALK often rudimentary, when present short (1-5 cm long), 0.5-2 cm thick, central to off-center or lateral, continuous with cap and more or less same color and texture, or darker. SPORE_PRINT pale yellow to pale brown; spores 4.5-7 x 2.54 microns, elliptical, smooth, hyaline under the microscope. Brown sterile cells (setae) abundant among basidia, straight and pointed. Cap tissue blackening in KOH (sometimes with a fleeting red intermediate phase). HABITAT Solitary or in groups on ground under conifers (presumably arising from roots or buried wood), sometimes also on stumps or bases of trunks; widely distributed. In our area it is fairly common throughout the mushroom season, especially in coastal pine forests. It causes a white pocket rot of the roots and butt of a wide variety of conifers in the pine family, but is especially fond of pine and spruce. EDIBILITY Unknown, but too tough to be of value. "

Species: schweinitzii
Common_Name: Dyer's Polypore
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY usually compound, composed of several caps arising in tiers from a common base, but sometimes simple (with one cap) and sometimes growing shelf-like on wood. CAP(s) 5-30 or more cm broad, circular to fan-shaped in outline; cushion-shaped becoming plane or depressed; soft and spongy when fresh and often knobby when actively growing, tough or corky in age, rigid and brittle when dry; surface covered with a dense felty or woolly mat of hairs, smoother in age; color variable: orange to ochraceous to yellowish or greenish-yellow (especially on the margin) when growing, becoming rusty-brown to dark brown in age (or from the center outward); staining brown to blackish when bruised and becoming entirely dark brown to blackish in old age; sometimes concentrically zoned with several of above colors; margin often wavy. Flesh yellowish to rusty-brown or brown, often appearing zoned. PORES 1-3 per mm or fused together to form larger pores; mustard-yellow to greenish when fresh, but quickly becoming brown or blackish when bruised or in age; tubes 2-10 mm long, usually decurrent. STALK(ifpresent) 1-6 cmlong and 1-5 cm thick, usually tapered downward, often rooting, central or off-center, same color and texture as cap. SPORE_PRINT white or tinged yellow to green; spores 5-9 x 3.5-5 microns, elliptical, smooth. Setae absent. Cap surface and tissue staining black in KOH, often with a fleeting cherry-red intermediate phase. HABITAT Solitary or in groups on or around dead and living conifers, usually but not always appearing terrestrial (originating from the roots); widely distributed and very common throughout the West. In our area it favors pine and Douglas-fir, the fruiting bodies usually appearing after the first fall rains but persisting year-round. The mycelium attacks the roots and heartwood of its host, causing a serious carbonizing decay known as ""red-brown butt rot."" It fractures the wood into cubical blacks as high as fifteen feet up the trunk, weakening the tree so that it blows over easily. It also occurs on coniferous slash, in which case it is more apt to be shelf-like than terrestrial. In the West it is one ofthe two or three most prevalent brown rot fungi. There is one report of it growing on eucalyptus. EDIBILITY Possibly poisonous. It contains a stimulant found in the roots ofthe kava kava plant, but apparently some toxic substances as well. It is too tough and hairy to be of food value anyway. However, it is prized by dye-makers for the rich and varied hues it imparts to yarn. "

Common_Name: Sulfur Shelf; Chicken of the Woods
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY annual, emerging kno blike or fingerlike, soon becoming shelf-like; soft and fleshy when young, tough in age. CAP 5-50 (70) cm broad and up to 4 cm thick, fan-shaped to elongated or semi-circular in outline; surface smooth to suede like, often uneven or wrinkled; red-orange to bright orange, yellow-orange, sulfur-yellow, or salmon (the margin usually yellow), fading slowly with age to yellowish, buff, or eventually dull whitish; margin at first thick and blunt. Flesh thick, soft and watery when very fresh, becoming tough and eventually crumbly; white to pale yellow or salmon-tinged; when very fresh often exuding yellow or orange droplets and reminiscent of uncooked chicken; odor fungal or rather pungent; taste nearly mild or acidic becoming quite sour or un-pleasant in age. PORES 2-4 per mm but barely visible when young, bright sulfur-yellow, but often darkening when bruised and fading slowly in age; tubes shallow (1-4 mm long). STALK absent or present only as a narrowed base. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 5-7 x 3.5-5 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, smooth. HABITAT Solitary or more often in overlapping clusters or shelving masses on dead stum ps and logs, sometimes also on living trees or sometimes growing in rosettes from roots or buried wood; usually appearing on the same stumps year after year; widely distributed and common. In our area it fruits mainly in the late summer and fall, but old fruiting bodies may persist for months. It grows on a wide range of hardwoods and conifers. In coastal California it favors eucalyptus (September-October, ushering in the new mushroom season) and to a lesser extent conifers and oaks (N ovember-December). In the Sierra Nevada it is common on fir in the summer; in eastern North America it favors oak. It causes a destructive red-brown carbonizing heart rot that eventually hollows out the tree, producing cracks in the wood in which thin sheets of white mycelium may appear. It is said to have caused considerable damage to British sailing vessels. EDIBILITY Edible and delectable when thoroughly cooked. However, there have been several cases of sulfur shelf poisoning on the west coast, so try it cautiously the first time and never eat it raw. When young the succulent flesh has a mild flavor, tofu-like texture, and ..Candy Corn""-like color, making it especially attractive and delicious in omelets. Maturing specimens are tougher and develop a strong sour flavor; their texture when cooked is reminiscent of white chicken meat, so they're good in sandwiches. If the specimens you find are mature (but not so old as to be asbestos-like)"" you can trim offthe tender, rapidly growing margin (about 5 cm), and perhaps return later for more! "

CAP 5-75 cm broad or more, 2-20 cm thick, usually fan-shaped or semi-circular in outline, with a hard surface crust that is usually cracked, furrowed, ridged, andlor lumpy or knobby in age, but not varnished; surface gray to brown or grayish-brown, sometimes aging grayish-black, but often covered with brown to cocoa-brown spore powder. Flesh punky or corky, 0.5-5 cm thick, brown or cinnamon-brown, rarely whitish. PORES barely visible (4-6 per mm), white or whitish when fresh but instantly turning brown when scratched; often dingy yellowish to brown when dried or in old age; tube layers distinctly stratified and separated by a thin layer of chocolate-brown tissue; each tube layer 4-12 or more mm deep. STALK usually absent. SPORE_PRINT brown or reddish-brown; spores 6-9.5x 4.5-7 microns, broadly elliptical to slightly truncate at apex, thick-walled, appearing minutely spiny. HABITAT Solitary or in groups on hardwood logs and stumps, or growing from wounds in living trees (usually near the ground); also common on conifers in some areas. Very widely distributed, found year-round. Its hosts include virtually every hardwood found in North America, plus numerous conifers. In coastal California it(and close relatives-see comments) is especially common on bay laurel, but can also be found on oak, magnolia, pepper trees, acacia, eucalyptus, elm, and Douglas-fir. Along with F omitopsis pinicola. it is the commonest conk in our area. The only regions where it seems to be absent are those where there aren't any trees! It usually attacks dead ordyingtrees, but can also be parasitic, producing a whitish, delignifying decay ofthe sapwood and heartwood. Infected trees blow over easily, so if one appears on a tree near your house-watch out!

CAP 2-20 (35) cm broad, 4-8 cm thick, circular to semi-circular to fan-shaped or kidney-shapedshaped in outline; surface usually with a varnished (shiny) surface crust, smooth or often concentrically zoned and grooved; color variable: dark red to reddish-brown, orange-brown, mahogany, or reddish-black, but often ochre or yellowish toward the margin (which is often white when actively growing); surface sometimes covered with brownish spore powder. Flesh ochra-ceo us-brown to dark brown, or pallid near the cap and brownish near the tubes; soft-corky or punky when fresh, tough when dry or old. PORES minute (4-7 per mm), whitish or yellowish-white when fresh, usually bruising or aging brown; tubes 2-20 mm long, one layer only (rarely two). STALK sometimes absent, but often present; usually attached laterally, but often vertical and well-developed, 3-14 cm long, 0.5-3 (4) cm thick; often gnarled or twisted, equal or enlarged below; dark red to reddish-black and appearing varnished like the cap. SPORE_PRINT brown; spores 7-13 x 5-8 microns, elliptical, double-walled, appearing minutely roughened. HABITAT Solitary or in small groups at bases of living hardwoods or on stumps and roots, very rarely on conifers; fruiting during mushroom season but often persisting year-round. Distribution worldwide-in both the tropical and temperate zones, from Canada to Argentina and Europe to Siberia, China, India, Australia, and Africa. It is fairly common in eastern North America but rather infrequent in California. It occurs on a wide 577 578 POL YPORACEAE & ALLIES range of hosts, but in North America is partial to maple. The very similar G. tsugae and G. oregonense occur on conifers (see comments). It is sometimes parasitic, but can also be saprophytic, producing a wet white rot in its host. EDIBILITY Too tough to be edible, but in the orient it is pictured in many classical art works and has been revered for centuries as a symbol of success and well-being (Ling Chih means"" marvelous herb"" or""mushroom of immortality""). It has been used in the treatment of cancer and various other maladies, and is believed by some to have the power of arousing the dead. one method of preparation is to soak the fruiting body in wine for several months. The resulting liquid ""essence"" or elixir is then drunk or put into candies. The varnished fruiting bodies are also used for decorative purposes. "

CAP 540 (75) cm broad, 3-22 cm thick, usually fan-shaped to semi-circular in outline; surface developing a thin, hard, resinous crust in age which is sometimes slightly varnished; usually at least partially reddish to dark red, but sometimes brown and often rusty or blackish-brown toward the base and brightly colored (white, yellow, ochraceous, or reddish) at the margin; concentrically furrowed andlor zoned in age; growing margin rounded, thick, and blunt. Flesh corky or woody, very tough, white to pinkish-buff or yellow when young, pale brownish or straw-colored in old age; usually bruising pinkish when actively growing; odor when fresh rather strong and fungal. PORES minute (3-5 per mm), white or pale yellow becoming brownish in old age; not turning brown when scratched but sometimes bruising yellow or pinkish-lilac; tube layers distinctly stratified, each layer 2-8 mm deep. STALK typically absent. SPORE_PRINT white or pale yellowish; spores 5-8 x 3.5-5 microns, cylindrical to elliptical, smooth. Flesh staining reddish to dark reddish-brown in KOH. HABITAT Solitary or in groups on dead trees, logs, and stumps or rarely on living trees, perennial; very common and widely distributed. It has been recorded from a wide range of hosts but is found mainly on conifers (in our area primarily Douglas-fir and redwood). It attacks both the heartwood and sapwood of its host, producing a slow carbonizing rot which fractures the wood and turns it brown (""brown crumbly rot""). Large mycelial mats can often be seen in the fractured wood. EDIBILITY This woody conk is not often eaten, but in a pinch you can use the following recipe developed by my wife: ""Saw into 2-inch cubes, then marinate in olive oil and dandelion wine for at least 48 hours (be sure to use LOTS of garlic!). Roast slowly on skewers over charcoal indefinitely (minimum time: 20 hours). Cool. Pound vigorously with a large mallet between two pieces of thick leather. Pulverize in a meat grinder and then force through a braced sieve (allow several hours for this step). Wrap the resulting mess in several thicknesses of cheesecloth and hang up someplace high and out of the way (on a clothesline or TV antenna). Allow to dangle thus for at least one week. (Aging has a mellowing effect, so you may want to try one year.) Wring periodically, making sure to reserve the drippings for gravy or as a motor oil additive. To eat, boil for twenty-four hours, squeeze thoroughly, garnish with gravel, and serve forth."" "

Flesh thick, white, cheesy when young but chalky or friable (crumbly) in mature or old specimens; odor farinaceous; taste very bitter. PORES 34 per mm, white or whitish when fresh, discoloring in age or drying; tube layers each 3-20 mm long, often stratified. STALK absent. SPORE_PRINT whitish; spores 4-5.5 x 34 microns, broadly elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Solitary or several on living and dead conifers; common year-round throughout much of the West, especially on larch and pine, but also on spruce, fir, hemlock, and Douglas-fir. It apparently does not occur in our area, but I have seen it on sugar pine and ponderosa pine on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada. It is said to be one of the three major destroyers of standing coniferous timber in the West (Phellinus pini and Phaeolus schweinitz;; are the other two). It causes ""felted heart rot,"" an extensive carbonizing trunk rot with thick mycelial mats often several feet long. EDIBILITY Friable but not fryable-it is inedible due to the bitter taste and tough texture, but has been used as a laxative and quinine substitute. (It does not have anti-malarial properties, but was thought to because of its taste.) Since the fruiting bodies often grow high above the ground, commercial ""quinine"" collectors used to dislodge them with rifles. "

HABITAT Solitary or more often in rows or columns up and down living or recently conifers; widely distributed and common, infecting all important members of the pine family (pine, Douglas-fir, etc.). Perennial, in our area occurring mainly on pine. It attacks the heartwood and sometimes the sapwood ofliving trees, resulting in a delignifying pocket rot known as ""conch rot."" The fruiting bodies are largely confined to older trees, partly because years of growth must take place before the mycelium can fruit. As a result, the appearance of a single fruiting body means that extensive heart rot has already taken place 10-15 feet above and below it. This fungus is said to cause more timber loss than any other. EDIBILITY Inedible (but see comments on edibility of Fomitopsis pinicola). "

HABITAT Solitary or in groups or columns on dead or sometimes living birch trees; common year-round in the northern hemisphere throughout the range of birch. I have not seen it in California, undoubtedly because birch does not occur naturally. However, it is found in Washington and Idaho and is very abundant in northeasternN orthAmerica. It causes a reddish-brown to yellow-brown carbonizing decay. EDIBILITY Edible when young (according to McIlvaine), but tough.

However, its breathtaking beauty poses a minor moral dilemma: should one ruthlessly uproot it for the sake of a meal, or leave it for others to see? "
"Genus: Hericium
Species: ramosum
Common_Name: Comb Hericium
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 8-35 cm broad and 6-15 cm high when mature, comprised of an open framework of rather delicate, toothed (spine-laden) branches arising from a tough, repeatedly branched rooting base or ""trunk""; pure white when fresh, discoloring creamy to buff or yellowish-tan in old age. Flesh white. SPINES more or less evenly distributed in lines along the branches (like teeth on a comb), sometimes also in small tufts at the branch tips; spines rather short (3-10 mm long or up to 25 mm long in the tufts). SPORE_PRINT white; spores 3-5 x 3-4 microns, nearly round, smooth or minutely roughened, amyloid. HABITAT Solitary or in small groups on fallen hard wood branches, logs, and stumps; widely distributed. It is said to be the most common Hericium in North America, but like the others, is uncommon in our area. I have found it in the fall, winter, and early spring on dead oak, and I have seen it in the summer on aspen and poplar in New Mexico. EDIBILITY Edible and delicious when cooked slowly, but not as fleshy as the other Hericiums. "
"Genus: Hericium
Species: erinaceus
Common_Name: Lion's Mane Hericium; Old Man's Beard
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY an unbranched mass of numerous long, closely-packed, icicle-like spines hanging from a tough, solid, hairy, rooting cushion of tissue; 8-40 cm or more broad and high when mature; entirely white when fresh, discoloring yellowish to tan or dingy ochre in age. Flesh white. SPINES (1) 2-5 (7) cm long, soft and pliant when fresh, with pointed tips. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 5-6.5 x 4-5.5 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, smooth to minutely roughened, amyloid. HABITAT Solitary (rarely several together) on wounds of living hard woods or on the cut ends of recently felled logs; widely distributed. In our area it favors oak and is fairly common (for a Hericium) in the fall, winter, and spring; farther north it grows on maple. EDIBILITY Excellent when fresh, but tougher than other Hericiums and sometimes developing a rather sour, unpleasant taste in age. Slow cooking is called for and the base should not be eaten-it's so tough that it's difficult to remove from the tree without a knife! "
"Genus: Dentinum
Species: repandum
Common_Name: Hedgehog Mushroom; Pig's Trotter
Group?: No
CAP 2-17 (25) cm broad, broadly convex to plane or depressed, the margin often wavy or deeply indented and at first inrolled; surface dry, more or less smooth, but sometimes cracking into scales in age; pale flesh-color to pale or dull orange, orange-tan, salmon, tan, or pale cinnamon to reddish-tawny (but white to creamy in vaT. album); bruised areas often darker orange. Flesh thick, occasionally zoned concentrically, firm, brittle, white, usually discoloring yellow to yellow-ochre or orange-brown when bruised; odor mild, taste mild to somewhat bitter or peppery. SPINES 2-7 mm long, whitish to yellowish, salmon-buff, or pale orange, bruising dark orange to ochraceous; slender, brittle but soft, usually decurrent. STALK 3-10 cm long, (0.5) 1-3 (5» cm thick, central or off-center, equal or enlarged below or occasionally tapered downward, firm, white or colored like cap but usually paler; bruising ochre to dark orange-brown; smooth or downy at base. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 6.5-9x 5.5-8 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, smooth. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, gregarious, or in troops on ground under both hard-woods and conifers; widely distributed throughout the north temperate zone and probably the most common of all the teeth fungi. In California it fruits throughout the mushroom season but develops slowly and normally does not peak until the late winter or early spring, when the wild irises are in bloom (see Color Plate 161) and most other fungi have long since rotted away. In our area it favors fern, bramble, and poison oak thickets under pine; in the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains it grows under a wide range of conifers, and in eastern North America it is often common under oaks in the summer and fall. EDIBILITY Edible and choice! It is comparable to the chanterelle in color, texture, and flavor, and like that species is usually maggot-free. It is easier to clean, however, and is also easier to recognize.The peppery taste (if present) disappears in cooking. It's superb in casseroles, tomato sauces, or sauteed with sour cream, but should be cooked slowly and lengthily to make it tender. Be careful to keep the spines clean while picking them! "

Flesh thick, firm but brittle; pallid to grayish, tan, or brownish; odor mild or when dry somewhat smoky or chocolate-like; taste mild to bitter. SPINES pale brown or grayish or pallid becoming dark brown in age, 2-15 mm long; soft, brittle, often slightly decurrent. STALK 4-10 cm long, 1.5-3.5 (5) cm thick, central or off-center, often enlarged below; some shade of brown, often hollow toward the top in age; usually more or less smooth. SPORE_PRINT brown; spores 6-8 x 5-7 microns, nearly round but promi-nently warted (angular-nodulose or shaped like a Maltese cross). HABITAT Solitary to gregarious on ground in woods; widely distributed-it is pro bably the most common Hydnum in North America. In many regions it is abundant under conifers in the late spring, summer, and fall. In our area it occurs under hardwoods in the late fall and winter, but is rare. I have seen enormous fruitings under spruce and fir. EDIBILITY Edible, but of poor quality. Many collections have a bitter taste and par-boiling does not necessarily help, plus it causes indigestion in some people. The European version is apparently better because it is often sold in markets there. "

HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious on ground in woods; locally common but erratic in its fruiting behavior-absent some years and abundant others; known onlyfrom western North America. In our area it fruits in the fall and winter under tanoak and madrone at higher elevations in the coastal mountains; in the Pacific Northwest, however, it favors conifers, especially hemlock and pine. It is yet another example of a conifer-lover that crosses over to tanoak-madrone (others include Armillaria ponderosa, Cantharellus subalbidus, Hygrophorus chrysodon, and Tricholoma aurantium). EDIBILITY Not recommended. Although not exactly bitter-tasting, small pieces which I sampled caused a peculiar burning sensation in the back of my throat.

STALK 5-13 cm long,2-5 cm thick, usually tapered downward, fleshy but very tough, buried deep in ground (or wood). Flesh firm, white, fairly tough or elastic; odor spicy-fragrant. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 5-7 x 3-5 microns, broadly elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Parasitic on the roots of conifers, usually growing solitary at or near the bases of trunks or stumps; found in the coniferous forests of western North America. It is not uncommon in our coastal pine forests, fruiting in the same spot year after year (or sometimes twice a year), usually in the late fall or winter. It also grows on Douglas-fir and other members of the pine family. It produces a brown or yellow carbonizing rot in its host, and is economically significant in some regions. The best place to look for it is in older forests where there are plenty of mature trees. S. spathulata (see below) can grow on hardwoods. EDIBILITY Edible and exceptional. The perfect mushroom for a special occasion, it is as elegant as it looks intelligent. Thorough cooking is necessary, however, to render it tender, and it is a royal pain-in-the-posterior to clean! Gentle sauteeing or parboiling followed by baking or stewing is best. Fresh specimens can be stored for a week or two in a cool dry place, but be sure to check first for maggots! "

Along with G. bonari (see comments), it is common in northern California and the Sierra Nevada in the summer, fall, and even spring, but like G. clavatus, it does not seem to occur on the coast south of San Francisco. It is also common in the Southwest, Pacific Northwest, and Rockies. EDIBILITY Not recommended. Some people pronounce it delicious, but others are adversely affected by it (they suffer gastric upsets) and the specimens I've sampled had an unpleasant sour taste. Its only asset is its distinctiveness-it would be very difficult to confuse it with anything other than its close relatives (see comments). "

SPORE_PRINT white; spores 7-9 x 5-5.5 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious on ground in woods; known only from the Pacific Northwest and California. It is quite abundant under second-growth conifers in the late summer, fall, and winter in Washington, oregon, and northern California, and I have also seen large fruitings in Idaho. In our area it fruits in the fall and early winter, but is only occasionally common. The best places to look for it are on the high, exposed ridges of our coastal mountains under tanoak and madrone or in manzanita thickets mixed with knobcone pine. It often grows with Armillaria ponderosa, another choice edible. EDIBILITY Edible and choice-as good as C. cibarius or even better, and like that species, rarely attacked by maggots. In the Pacific Northwest the buttons are firm, meaty, and very compact-ideal for marinating or prolonged refrigeration. Unfortunately, it is not nearly so common in our area and the fruiting bodies, when found, are often water-logged and overripe. "

HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious on ground in woods, occurring throughout the north temperate zone and very common on the west coast in the fall, winter, and spring. In northern California and the Pacific Northwest it grows mainly with conifers, but in our area it favors live oaks, especially those at the edges of pastures. It hasa long growing season and is ajoy to find-brilliant splashes of gold against the subdued backdrop of decaying leaves. If you see one, probe around and you'll probably uncover more-they often hide under the humus. If rainfall is sufficient, successive crops are prod uced over a long period of time, so check your patches regularly (but don't check mine!). EDIBILITY Edible and choice-the best known wild mushroom in California, if not in North America. It is so plentiful and popular on the west coast that it is now being harvested commercially and shipped abroad or sold to restaurants and markets. A few tips for the uninitiated: Chanterelles should always be cooked as they are somewhat fibrous raw. Pick selectively-firm specimens will keep in the refrigerator for a week, whereas waterlogged individuals will rot rapidly and cook up slimy. Even firm ones have a high water content and should be sauteed slowly and thoroughly in an open pan. You waste them if you can't taste them, so don't just mix them in with a bunch of other vegetables. They are best in simple dishes that highlight their delica te fla vor and fruity fragrance-cream of chanterelle soup is a traditional favorite. on the west coast chanterelles are virtually free of maggots, an asset keenly appreciated by those who hunt them-but they're often full of dirt, a quality deeply detested by those who have to clean them! (If your ""chanterelles"" are pristine and wormy, they may not be chanterelles!). Curiously, it's just the opposite in the eastern United States, where they are usually quite spotless, but often lunched on by maggots! Imported chanterelles can be purchased in small tins at delicatessens-for an outrageous price, of course. They are low in protein but high in vitamin A. Attempts to cultivate them commercially have not been successfuL "

SPORE_PRINT whitish to buff or pale yellow; spores 8-11 x 5-7 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Scattered or in groups, clumps, or lacy clusters in woods; widely distributed. It is common in our area in the winter and spring under hardwoods(live oak, tanoak, man-zanita, madrone, huckleberry), but farther north it fruits in the late fall under conifers. South of San Francisco it rarely appears before Christmas, usually peaks at the same time that the fetid adder's tongue blooms,andmayfruitonintoApril. IneasternNorthAmerica it is largely replaced by C.fallax (see comments), which also occurs in our area. Though terrestrial, it often fruits near fallen branches or at the bases of trees or manzanita burls. EDIBILITY one of my fifteen ""five favorite flavorful fleshy fungalfructifications."" Like myself, it is thin, tough, and dark, and like myself, it goes largely unappreciated. It is forever being passed up in favor of the larger, fleshier, more colorful and impressive types, yet its flavor is superb and its potential unlimited. It is partly to blame for this sad state of affairs, for its appearance is admittedly drab and rather somber, and it shuns attention, blending unobtrusively into the dark, secretive situations where it thrives. But though it takes an accomplished eye to detect its presence in the woods (from the top it looks like a hole in the ground), anyone can detect its presence in a dish-for it cooks up black, announcing itself with unmistakable earthy authenticity. It can play any culinary position with equal finesse, from first base to second fiddle, enhancing practically any dish, be it soup, souffle, or sauce. Like its more popular cousin the chanterelle, it is not often inhabited by maggots. Dried and powdered it has a cheesy odor and is known, quite appropriately, as ..Poor People's Truffle."" "

In California I have seen impressive fruitings in Yosemite National Park and the Trinity Alps, but have found it only once in our area, near Big Sur. The fruiting bodies do not decay readily and seem to like cool weather (either late in the season or in the spring). EDIBILITY Highly prized by some people-presumably for its color and texture-for it has no flavor that I can detect. It can be eaten raw in salads, pickled, or candied , but should not be cooked because of its high water content. Larry Stickney says if it is sucked on a hot day it ""cools you right down."" "

Outer layer of peridium(skin) thick when young (24 mm), at first smooth (with texture of kid glove) and pure white or brownish-stained (but in the California version often breaking up into brownish scales even when young), then cracking up into flat scales or plates which eventually flake off to expose the thin olive-brown inner layer-which soon disintegrates-or both layers falling off together. STERILE_BASE absent or rudimentary, but a cord-like ""root"" often present. SPORE_MASS at first white and firm or cheesy, becoming greenish-yellow and mushy with an unpleasant odor (like old urine), finally deep olive-brown to brown and powdery. Spores 3.5-6 microns, round or nearly round, smooth or minutely spiny, apiculate. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups or large circles in fields, pastures, open woods, cemeteries, on exposed hillsides, along roads, in drainage ditches, etc.; fairly common in eastern North America and the Midwest. The west coast form, which is slightly different (see comments), is sometimes abundant in our area after the first fall rains and again in the spring. In fact, when conditions are favorable it is not unusual to find 30-40 pounds on a casual jaunt through a ""puffball pasture."" Because of its preference for open hillsides, it can often be spotted from the road, Large specimens, in fact, have been mis-taken by passersby for herds of grazing sheep! (Mushroom hunters, on the other hand, are more likely to mistake grazing sheep for giant puffballs.) Dried specimens found under houses have been mistaken for bleached skulls, while a sinister-looking individual found in England during the war was labelled ""Hitler's Secret Weapon"" and used for propaganda purposes at an exhibition to raise war funds! EDIBILITY Edible and choice when the flesh is firm and white, but with laxative effects on certain individuals. It can be sliced and fried like pancakes, or better yet, cubed like tofu and dropped into clear soups or eaten raw in salads. The tough outer skin should be peeled and those which have begun to ripen should be discarded. Size it not necessarily an indication of maturity, so slice them open in the field. This will enable you to check for maggots, which are fanatically fond of them. Infested areas can be trimmed away and the solid portions carried home. Dried giant puffballs have been used as sponges, tinder (before matches were invented), toys, and dyes. They were burned under beehives to stupefy bees and used to squelch bleeding. "

HABITAT Solitary, widely scattered, or in groups or ""flocks"" in fields, under sagebrush or juniper and in other open areas; confined to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America, and sometimes common, especially in the late spring and summer. I have seen it in New Mexico and Idaho, and in the mountains of southern California. A similar but less warty species is common along the west coast (see the C. gigantea group). EDIBILITY Edible and choice when firm and white inside, but with laxative effects on certain individuals. Like C. gigantea, it was apparently eaten by pioneers as well as by some Native Americans. Be sure to check for maggots when gathering them, and re-member. any specimens whose flesh shows the slightest traces of color (yellow, greeen, or brown) are no longer good to eat (unless you're a maggot!).

HABITAT Solitary, scattered, gregarious, or clustered on ground in woods and under trees, along roads, or sometimes in the open; very widely distributed. It is probably the most abundant woodland puffball in North America, and our region is no exception. It can be found most any time in our area, but usually fruits in the fall or winter. EDIBILITY Edible when firm and white inside, but specimens showing the slightest traces of yellow should not be eaten. It occasionally occurs in enough quantity to merit collecting, but in my experience it is bland at best and bitter at worst. "

SPORE_CASE with a thin, brittle peridium (skin) that is variously colored (but usually yellowish, purplish, olive-black, or brown) and often lustrous and soon ruptures irregularly or flakes away. Upper portion of fruiting body containing hundreds of seedlike peridioles which gradually disintegrate, turning into a crumbly or dusty mass of brown spores (the disintegration process starts at the top of fruiting body and proceeds downward). Peridioles small (24 mm long), elongated to oval or circular, whitish to greenish-yellow, yellow, brownish, or vinaceous, at first imbedded in a sticky dark or blackish substance which dries out and becomes brittle or crumbly at maturity. Lower portion of fruiting body typically consisting of a fibrous, stalklike, persistent, sterile, rooting base which may have coarse greenish-yellow mycelial fibers attached. VOLVA absent. SPORE_MASS powdery when mature, dark brown to cinnamon-brown. Spores 7-12 microns, round, warty or spiny. HABITAT Solitary, widely scattered, or in small groups on or along roads, in waste places, and in hardpacked, poor, sandy, or gravelly soil; very widely distributed, but especially common in California and the Pacific N orthwest(the largest fruitings I've seen were in the Siskiyou Mountains of northern California). In our area it fruits chiefly in the late summer and fall, but is slow to decay and can be found most any time. It forms mycorrhiza with a wide range of trees and shrubs (oak, pine, etc.) and is said to be of value in reforestation projects. EDIBILITY Not recommended. In Europe it is known as the ""Bohemian Truffle"" and used as an aromatic seasoning when unripe, and in China it is employed medicinally. It is scarcely appetizing, however, and should be tried very cautiously, if at alL The name tinctorius reflects its use as a dye-a variety of rich colors (mostly browns and golds, but also blacks and dark blues) can be obtained, depending on the mordants used and the type of soil in which it is found.

SPORE_MASS divided up into numerous whitish-walled ""cells"" (peridioles), but all but the lowermost ""cell"" walls disintegrating, so that the mature spore mass is brown and powdery, usually with an unpleasant odor (like decaying fish); lowermost ""cell"" walls often persisting after the spores have been dispersed as flattened, pointed ""teeth"" on the inner surface of the spore case, giving it a pitted or reticulate appearance. Spores 5-7 microns, round or nearly round, warted or spiny. HABITAT Solitary, widely scattered, or in small groups (often in tufts of 2-5 individuals and occasionally two emerging from a single volva) in barren sandy soil or clay, waste places, etc. It is widespread in the arid and semi-arid parts of the West, but is most com-mon in the deserts of southern California, the Four Corners area, and the Southwest-often near or under saltbush (A triplex) or along washes. It fruits after seasonal rains, but the fruiting bodies are practically impervious to bacterial and fungal decay, persisting for as long as 30 years in their natural environment! Mature specimens can protrude from the soil like dusty roots (in the grand tradition of Pisolithus tinctorius), or remain underground, depending on the hardness of the soil and weather conditions. W. H. Long, who gathered a gaggle of them near Antelope Valley, California, reports that developing specimens raised hard blocks of soil weighing 15 pounds each!

FRUITING_BODY beginning as an ""egg"" up to 6 cm high. PERIDIUM (skin) white to yellowish-white in one variety, lurid pinkish to purple in another (see comments), with a gelatinous layer beneath; rupturing to form a volva as the stalk elongates and thrusts the slimy, swollen ""head"" upward. CAP (""head"") 1.5-4 cm broad, coated with the putrid, copious spore slime which eventually drips off or is carried or washed away, revealing the whitish reticulate (pitted and ridged) surface beneath; top with a hole which is sometimes covered by a clinging piece of the peridium (volva) andlor by numerous flies. STALK 1.5-3 cm thick, equal or tapered at both ends, entirely white or sometimes pinkish below; minutely honeycombed (spongelike), hollow, fragile. INDUSIUM (""veil"") absent or rudimentary. VOLVA present at base of stalk as a white to pinkish or purple, loose, lobed sack formed by the ruptured peridium; base usually with a thick, similarly-colored mycelial cord(s). SPORE_MASS slimy or mucilaginous, olive-green to olive-brown, with an obnoxious odor at maturity (see p. 765). Spores 3-5 x 1.5-2.5 microns, elliptical or oblong, smooth. HABITAT Solitary or in groups or clusters in lawns, gardens, sandy or cultivated soil, under trees or shrubs, in rich humus, etc.; widely distributed and especially common in the West, fruiting whenever conditions are favorable. McIlvaine states that, ""its favorite abode is in kitchen yards and under wooden steps where, when mature, it will compel the household to seek it out in self-defense,"" and his contemporary Nina Marshall says, ""the distracted housewife searches in vain for a solution to the difficulty and the odor disappears as mysteriously as it came. If she is one of the initiated, however, she will search until she finds the haunt of the offender andthen destroy it on the spot to avoid further repitition of the nuisance."" The largest fruitings I have seen were on the lawn of a school in Los Angeles, and in front of an old cathedrl in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Stinkhorn specialist William Burk recalls seeing massive clusters that apparently sprung from the foundation of a house in Salt Lake City, Utah. If the ""eggs"" are carried home and transplanted in cool, damp earth, more often than not they will continue to develop so that the fasci-nating elongation process can be observed firsthand. EDIBILITY Not poisonous (see comments on p. 765), but as Alexander Smith says, ""who would want to eat even the eggs?"" Captain Charles McIlvaine (the plenipotentiary extraordinaire of turn-of-the-century toadstool testers), for one. He says, ""(the eggs) are semigelatinous, tenacious, and elastic, like bubbles of some thick substance. In this condition, they demand to be eaten. . . cut in slices and fried or stewed, they make a most tender, agreeable food."" "

In eastern North America it i:. most often found under oak, maple, beech, hickory, elm, ash, fruit trees. and other hardwoods, especially in May (or in the words of Ingrid Bartelli, ""when the oak leaves are as big as squirrel's ears""). Large crops can also be found around the bases of dying (but not quite dead) elms attacked by Dutch elm disease. In the West I look for it under deciduous oaks and in sandy soil or riverbottoms where there is willow, cottonwood, or alder, from February to Mayor June depending on the elevation and clima te.

Like other morels, its season is the spring(or early summer at higher altitudes), but"" freak"" fruitingscan occur in the fall, particularly if a warm wet spell follows cold weather. In coastal California, where the seasons are not strongly defined. black morels occur year-round. but seldom in quantity. In colder regions they are often abundant, usually two to five weeks after the snow melts. Look for them in the Sierra Nevada when the snow plants (bright red sapro-phytic plants) have fully emerged, and in the Cascades when the calypso orchids are in bloom (see Color Plate 199). Don't expect to find them everywhere, however. For one thing, you face fierce competition from other collectors; for another, ttrey are devilishly difficult to see, because they look just like fallen pine or fir cones (see Color Plate 202). Also, they show a definite preference for semi-disturbed areas, e.g., campgrounds, along roads, and in logged and burned areas. Bushels can be harvested one to two years after a forest fire, providing the spring weather is favorable. EDIBILITY Edible and delectable (see comments on pp. 785-786).

It is not very common in our area (perhaps the winters aren't cold enough), but is often abundant in the Sierra Nevada, Cascades, and other mountain ranges of the West. It is often encountered while morel hunting. The fruiting bodies persist for several weeks before decaying. EDIBILITY Dangerously poisonous, at least raw! Although eaten without ill effect by many people, this species has caused numerous deaths in Europe (see p. 799 for more details). Far fewer cases of poisoning have been reported from North America, suggesting that the American version is safer than the European one, or that certain ecological variants are less toxic. However, the paucity of poisonings may also indicate that fewer Americans eat it, or that those who do treat it with more caution. I certainly don't think it's worth the risk.

Asci mostly 8-spored, round to pear-shaped, not forming a hymenium, disintegrating before the spores are fully mature. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious in soil or humus under conifers or less commonly hardwoods; widely distributed and very common, but seldom seen by the average mushroom hunter because it grows underground. It is usually found 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) below the surface, often imbedded in or resting on clay soil at the point where it meets the humus layer. In many regions it is parasitized by species of Cordyceps-which serve as an above-ground indicator of its presence-but I have yet to observe this in our area. It fruits throughout the mushroom season and can sometimes be gathered by the bushel. I have found it under hemlock and pine in northern California, and Herb Saylor reports prolific fruitings from Mendocino County. Alexander Smith calls it ""perhaps the most common hypogeous [underground] fungus in North America""-and he should know, since he has collected so many of them!

Common_Name: Velvety Black Earth Tongue
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 2-8 cm tall, cylindrical to club-shaped or more often with a distinct ""head"" (i.e., fruiting body shaped more orIess like the tongue ofa bell). Fertile""head"" when distinct 3-8 mm broad, usually flattened laterally or compressed, oval or elongated to spade-or arrowhead-shaped; surface dry, minutely hairy or velvety, sometimes wrinkled, black. Flesh thin, tough, usually brownish. STALK thin (1-4 mm thick), more or less equal, densely velvety, often twisted or curved, tough, black. SPORES 80-195 (210) x 5-7 microns, greatly elongated, smooth, brown under the microscope, typically with 15 septa (partitions) when mature, but some varieties with consistently fewer or more septa. Both stalk and head lined with long brown sterile cells (setae). Asci 8-spored. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, gregarious, or tufted in humus, moss, or soil (or occa-sionally on rotten wood), usually in woods; very widely distributed and common. It is the most abundant earth tongue in our area, sometimes carpeting large tracts of humus with its little black clubs. In seems to favor habitats shunned by other mushrooms (e.g., red-wood), and usually fruits in the winter or spring. Like other black fungi, it is difficult to see. EDIBILITY Supposedly edible, but much too tough to be worthwhile. "

Fertile ""head"" 4-12 mm broad, dark green to pea-green, green, olive-green, or even bluish-green, smooth or furrowed, often flattened or com-pressed in older specimens. Flesh greenish, rather tough. STALK 2-5 mm thick, colored like the head or paler green, usually thinner; surface minutely scurfy or scaly, but sometimes smooth in age. SPORES 14-22 x 4-6 microns, sausage-shaped to spindle-shaped, smooth, hyaline (colorless) under the microscope, not septate or septate only when old. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups or tufts in soil, moss, and duff under both hardwoods and conifers; widely distributed. It is not uncommon in coastal California in the winter and early spring, but is often overlooked because of its small size and green color. I find it most often under redwood and tanoak. EDIBILITY Too small to be worthwhile. "

"Genus: Neolecta
Species: irregularis
Common_Name: Irregular Earth Tongue
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 1-7 cm tall, clublike to very irregular (lobed, sparingly branched, grooved and twisted, etc.), usually flattened or compressed, 0.4-2.5 cm broad at apex. Fertile surface pale yellow to bright yellow or orange-yellow. Flesh white or yellowish, rather tough. STALK sometimes absent but usually present as a sterile, pale yellow to white base beneath the fertile portion; 1-6 (10) mm thick (usually thinner than fertile area). SPORES 5.5-10 x 3.5-5 microns, elliptical to nearly round, smooth, not septate, hyaline (colorless) under the microscope. Asci lining at least the upper part of (and sometimes the entire) fruiting body. HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious or occasionally tufted on ground, moss, or duff, usually under conifers; widely distributed. Along with N. vitellina (see comments), it occurs throughout much of the West, but is apparently absent in our area. I have seen large fruitings under spruce and fir in New Mexico and oregon in the summer and fall. EDIBILITY In my opinion, not worth collecting. McIlvaine, as usual, dissents: ""Those fortunate enough to find this species will hunt for it again assiduously. Even raw, when cut in strips, it makes a picturesque and delicious salad."" "
