"Genus: Hydnotrya
Species: variiformis
Common_Name: N/A
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 0.74 cm broad, round to somewhat flattened, depressed, or lobed. Exterior minutely velvety, whitish to creamy to buff or yellowish to cinnamon-buff or brownish, not warted. INTERIOR variable in configuration, but small specimens often containing a simple cavity with a prominent opening, and larger ones usually with several chambers or narrow, branching canals formed by crowding and infolding of the outer-wall; canals usually empty but their sides often fused; white or pallid, but the hymenium (fertile tissue) often brownish to pinkish-stained orange at maturity. SPORES 32-36 x 24-28 microns, elliptical, smooth becoming minutely pitted and wrinkled at maturity, yellowish-brown under the microscope. Asci borne in a palisade (hymenium) that lines the canals or cavity, typically 8-spored. HABITAT Solitary or in groups in soil or inside very rotten wood under conifers; oc-casional (along with H. cerebriformis-see comments) in the Sierra Nevada, Cascades, and other western mountains.

"Genus: Genea
Species: harknessii
Common_Name: Dark Geode Truffle
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY underground, 0.5-2.5 cm broad, round to flattened to very knobby and irregularly lobed, usually with an apical opening to the interior and a tuft of mycelium at the base. Exterior dark reddish-brown to dark brown to dark gray or black (but often with a thin whitish covering of hyphae when very young), divided into small, often pyra-midal warts. INTERIOR basically hollow, but often interrupted by irregular projections of strile tissue from the outer-wall; inner surface of wall warted and dark brown to blackish or bluish-gray; sterile tissue white to grayish. SPORES averaging 24-28 x 22-27 microns, elliptical to nearly round, hyaline (colorless) under the microscope, smooth at first but finely warted at maturity. Asci 8-spored, arranged in a palisade (hymenium). HABITAT Solitary to gregarious in humus or soil under oak, manzanita, coyote bush (Baccharis) and other trees and shrubs; known only from the west coast. It is fairly com-mon (for a truffle) in California in the winter and spring, especially in February-March. I've found this species, G. gardneri. and G. compacta (see comments) under live oak. It also occurs in the Sierra Nevada. Like other Geneas, it often growsjust below the ground or on the soil surface beneath the humus, and is difficult to see because of its color. EDIBILITY Prized by pigs, but I can find no mention of humans eating it. "
"Genus: Genea
Species: intermedia
Common_Name: Red Geode Truffle
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY underground, 0.5-2.5 cm broad, sometimes roundish(especially when young), but more often lobed or knobby, with or without an apical opening to the interior and a basal mycelial tuft. Exterior reddish to reddish-brown, vinaceous, or vinaceous-purple, the lobes or protuberances superimposed with minute warts.

"Genus: Genea
Species: arenaria
Common_Name: Hairy Geode Truffle
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY underground, 1-3 cm broad, usually irregularly lobed or coarsely knobby (at least at maturity), with or without an opening to the interior and a basal tuft of mycelium. Exterior brown to pale brown, divided into small, often pyramidal warts and covered with scattered long brown to dark brown hairs. INTERIOR basically hollow, but the cavity usually irregular in shape due to infolding ofthe outer-wall; inner surface finely warted and colored like the exterior or paler; sterile tissue whitish. SPORES averaging 22-32 x (16) 20-24 microns, mostly elliptical, with minute scattered warts. Asci arranged in a palisade (hymenium), typically 8-spored. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in small groups in soil under trees (mainly live oak); known only from California and oregon. It typically fruits from the late fall through the early spring (November-April) and is not uncommon in our area. However, it seldom occurs in quantity and is easily overlooked because of its brown color. EDIBILITY Unknown. "
"Genus: Genabea
Species: cerebriformis
Common_Name: White Geode Truffle
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY underground, 0.4-1.5 (2.5) cm broad (but usually under 1 cm); smaller specimens often roundish, larger ones usually quite irregular (knobby, lobed, or brain-like) in shape and typically with several openings to the interior; lacking a basal tuft of mycelium. Exterior covered by small, more or less conical warts superimposed on each knob; white to yellowish-white or yellow-gray. INTERIOR often a single cavity in small specimens, but in larger ones usually consisting of a mazelike system of canals formed by infolding and inward projections of the wall; colored more or less like exterior. Odor mild or strong. SPORES 28-44 microns, round, smooth at first but covered with long, slender spines at maturity; hyaline (colorless) to grayish-yellow (in age) under the microscope. Asci arranged in a palisade (hymenium), typically 8-spored. HABITAT Solitary to gregarious in soil or humus in woods and under trees; fairly common (for a truffle) in western North America under various trees, but especially fond of Douglas-fir. In California it fruits, like other truffles, in the winter, spring, and early summer. Although small, its light color makes it fairly conspicuous. EDIBILITY I can find no information on it; too small to be of much value. "

"Genus: Barssia
Species: oregonensis
Common_Name: Depressed Truffle
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 1-2.5 cm broad, roundish but usually more or less flattened or slightly lobed, typically with a prominent depression or cavity at the top; firm but not hard, without a mycelial tuft at base. Exterior smooth to roughened or finely warted, pale ochre-buff to orange-cinnamon to brick-red or reddish-brown. INTERIOR composed of empty, unconnected, broad or narrow canals, many of which empty into the depression (i.e., more or less solid except for the canals); white to pale gray, even at maturity. SPORES 24-36 x 12-21 microns, oblong-elliptical, smooth, colorless under the microscope. Asci mostly 8-spored, forming a palisade (hymenium) that lines the canals. HABITAT Solitary or in small groups in soil in woods, associated with Douglas-fir and possibly other trees; known only from the West (California, oregon, Idaho). Like most truffles, it is commonest in the spring and early summer. I have yet to find it in our area, but see comments. EDIBILITY Presumably edible; I haven't tried it. "
"Genus: Picoa
Species: carthusiana
Common_Name: oregon Black Truffle
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 0.5-4.5 (8) cm broad, round or nearly round to slightly irregular, without a mycelial tuft at the base. Exterior minutely warted, black to dusky slate-violet. INTERIOR more or less solid, composed of large pockets of fertile tissue marbled with paler (whitish to buff) sterile veins; fertile tissue whitish to buff when young but becoming grayish-green to greenish-blue in age; sometimes exuding a clear latex when fresh which slowly (overnight) stains white paper pale violet. SPORES (56) 74-84 x 20-35 microns, lemon-or spindle-shaped, smooth, typically with one giant oil droplet at maturity; pallid to greenish-yellow becoming brown at maturity (under the microscQpe). Asci typically 8-spored, imbedded in the tissue (not forming a palisade). HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in small groups in soil and humus in woods; known from Europe and the western United States. In oregon and California it favors Douglas-fir. In our area it fruits in the spring and summer, but is more common in oregon, where it occurs earlier. It has been found at Point Reyes by Herb Saylor and Dennis Desjardin, in July. EDIBILITY Edible and delicious raw, according to truffle connoisseur Gary Menser. "
