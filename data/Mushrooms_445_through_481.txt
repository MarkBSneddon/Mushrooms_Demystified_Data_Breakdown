CAP (5) 7-20 (30) cm broad, rounded becoming convex and then broadly convex to plane or somewhat irregular; surface viscid when moist, practically smooth but usually with flattened fibrils, sometimes pitted in age; dark red to reddish-brown, or at times rusty-brown, rusty-orange, or brown (see comments); margin with flaps of sterile tissue when young, which break up into segments or disappear in age. Flesh thick, firm becoming soft at maturity, white, usually bruising smoky-gray to purple-gray or bluish-gray when cut, but often very slowly or only in certain areas. PORES and tubes whitish to pale olive, olive-gray, or grayish, usually deep dingy olive-buff in age; not blueing when bruised but often discoloring brown. STALK 8-20 cm long, 1.5-4 cm thick at apex, equal or often thicker or swollen below, tough, fibrous, solid, white or whitish when fresh, but roughened by numerous small projecting scabers that are pallid at first but deep brown to black by maturity; lower portion often bruising (or already stained) bright blue to greenish-blue. SPORE_PRINT brown; spores 13-19 x 3-5 microns, spindle-shaped to elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Solitary to widely scattered or gregarious on ground, associated with man-zanita and madrone but often growing in mixed woods; known only from the west coast. It is common in our area in the fall and winter and is easily the most prevalent Leccinum in coastal California. It is seldom as prolific as B. edulis, but 1 have seen more than fifty prime fructifications under a patch of stunted madrones in the middle of a pasture. EDIBILITY Edible and esteemed by many boletivores, but disappointingly bland in my experience. Mature or waterlogged specimens should be dried in order to concentrate their flavor and get rid of excess moisture. In one blind tasting of several local boletes (all fresh), it placed next to last-slightly behind the boring Boletus subtomentosus but ahead of the abominable Suillusfuscotomentosus. Michael Cabaniss, who did the line drawings for this book, says: ""I have tried only dried slices, a form which is not the most visually stimulating. . . their consistency is rather grainy, giving the gustatory experience of dried earth or decomposed redwood chips. Dried slices are not even chewy; they break up readily when inserted into the oral cavity and are swallowed with great difficulty."" "

Flesh thick, often rather soft in age, white, turning bluish-gray to purple-gray or fuscous when bruised or cut, but sometimes very slowly or erratically. PORES and tubes pallid or whitish when young, becoming olive-buff to grayish or dull yellowish-buff in age; not blueing when bruised (but may stain yellowish to brown, lavender, or vinaceous). STALK 6-15 cm long, 1-2.5 cm thick at apex, equal or swollen below, dry, solid, rather tough and fibrous; white or whitish when fresh, but roughened by numerous small, projecting scabers which are initially pallid but become reddish-orange to brown and finally blackish by maturity; base or lower portion often staining or discoloring blue. SPORE_PRINT brown to yellow-brown; spores 11-18x 4-6 microns, spindle-shaped to elongated-elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious or in troops on ground in woods and at their edges; associated primarily if not exclusively with aspen, and common in the summer and early fall wherever aspen occurs. It is abundant in the Sierra Nevada (along with other Leccinums-see comments), and I have seen enormous fruitings in the Southwest and Rocky Mountains shortly after the blue columbines bloom. It is also abundant in Alaska. EDIBILITY Edible and good. Though not the equal of Boletus edulis. it is far better in flavor than its coastal counterpart, L. manzanitae. Like most Leccinums it darkens when cooked or dried. If this intimidates you, that's fine with me-I'll be more than happy to take them off your hands! "

Flesh thick, soft and watery when fresh and oozing with 4ark reddish juice whitish to grayish, olive-brown, or reddish, streaked or marbled horizontally with paler veins (usually reddening after standing) taste rather sour or strongly acidic. PO RES 1-3 per mm. circular, whitish to yellowish, buff, or pale flesh-color, becoming dark reddish-brown when bruised or in old age tubes 10-15 mm long, closely packed but discrete (their walls not joined). STALK absent, or if present then lateral and rather short, 2-6 (10) cm long, 1-4 cm thick tougher than the cap but continous with it and colored similarly, firm. SPORE_PRINT pinkish-salmon to pale ochre or pale rusty-brown; spores 4-6 x 3-4 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Solitary or sometimes several together at the bases of hardwoods and on stumps, especially of chestnut and oak; widely distributed, but most common in Europe and eastern North America. In coastal California it seems to grow exclusively onchinqua-pin (a close relative of chestnut) in the fall and winter. In my experience it is not common, but Chroogomphus-king Ciro Milazzo discovered one large local fruiting of over thirty individuals on some recently cut chinquapin stumps. It causes a serious carbonizing decay in its host. The rich brown hue it imparts to the wood is prized by cabinetmakers. EDIBILITY Edible. The strong sour taste is displeasing to some, esteemed by others. Parboiling may remove some of the sourness as well as some of the nutrients (it is rich in vitamin C). I like to marinate thin, raw slices in seasoned vinegar and olive oil. "

The ""tubers"" of P. tuberaster are inedible because they are full of dirt. However, they are sold in southern Italy under the name pietra fungaia (""Stone Fungus""). Buyers plant the ""tubers"" in flower pots, water them regularly, and then eat the fruiting bodies that result. "
"Genus: Grifola
Species: frondosa
Common_Name: Hen of the Woods; Sheep's Head
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY compound, 15-60cm broad ormore,consistingofa mass of numerous small, overlapping caps arising from a common, fleshy, repeatedly branched base. CAPS 2-7 (10) cm broad, spoon-shaped, tongue-shaped, or fan-shaped and tlattened; surface dry, smooth or rough to fibrillose, gray to brown or grayish-brown; margin often wavy. Flesh white and firm, rather tough; taste mild when young. PORES 1-3 per mm, white or yellowish; tubes shallow (2-3 mm long), decurrent. STALKS (branches) smooth, fleshy but tough, white or pale grayish, off-center or more often lateral (attached to sides of caps). SPORE_PRINT white; spores 5-7 x 3.5-5 microns, broadly elliptical, smooth. HABITAT At or near the bases of trees and stumps (usually oak), fruiting year after year in the same spots; widely distributed, but common only in eastern North America. It has been reported from Idaho, but is rare in the West and apparently absent in our area. It causes a delignifying butt rot of both the heartwood and sapwood of its host. EDIBILITY Edible and choice-along with the sulfurshelfand beefsteak fungus, the best of the polypores for the table. Long, slow cooking is recommended and only the young, tender caps are worth eating. ""Allergies"" have been reported. It is excellent pickled. "
"Genus: Bondarzewia
Species: montana
Common_Name: N/A
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY simple (with a cap and stalk) or compound (with numerous caps and stalks arising from a common base), but often fingerlike when first emerging or taking the form of a lumpy, misshapen, or rosette-like mass (when compound); often massive when mature (up to I m (3 ft.) broad if compound); usually arising from a rooting base. CAP(s) 5-25 cm broad when mature, convex to irregular or depressed; surface dry, finely velvety to fibrillose, or becoming smooth; tan or ochre to brown or dark brown, sometimes paler when immature. Flesh fairly thick, white, firm but brittle when fresh; taste mild or sometimes bitter in age. PORES fairly large (0.5-2 mm broad), usually angular or irregular in shape or breaking up to form ""teeth""; pore surface often lumpy or nodulose in compound fruiting bodies, white to creamy or buff, dingier when dried or in age; tubes 1-6 mm long, usually decurrent. STALK(s) central to lateral, continuous with individual caps and simi-lar in color and texture, usually arising from a ta pered, underground, gnarly rooting base that is 4-12 cm long and 2-5 cm thick. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 5-7 microns, round, with conspicuous amyloid warts. HABITAT Solitary or in groups under conifers, usually near stumps or trunks (presumably arising from roots or buried wood); locally common in the late summer and fall in western North America, particularly at higher elevations. I have found it in quantity near Lake Tahoe under fir and white pine, but ha ve not seen it on the coast. The very similar B. berkeleyi (see comments) favors living hardwoods, producing a serious delignifying butt rot of the heartwood (""string and ray rot"") that completely hollows out its host. EDIBILITY : Tempting because of its size, but rather tough and sometimes bitter to boot. It is probably harmless, but certainly not the equal of Grifolafrondosa. "

CAP 5-20 (30) cm broad and 2-10 cm thick, convex or plane; surface at first densely covered with stiff or bristly hairs, the hairs tending to wear away in age; bright reddish-orange to yellowish-brown to rusty-yellow when fresh, becoming brown to dark reddish-brown or even blackish in age. Flesh up to 5 (10) cm thick, at first watery or spongy(but fibrous), tougher in age; rusty to rusty-yellow to dark reddish-brown; odor often rather pleasant when fresh. PORES 1-3 (4) per mm, yellowish to brown or rusty-yellow, sometimes with an olive tinge and sometimes beaded with droplets, darkening with age or where bruised; tubes 0.5-3 cm long. STALK absent. SPORE_PRINT ochre-to chestnut-brown; spores 7 .5-11 x 6-9 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, smooth. Flesh darkening (staining red to black) in KOH. HABITAT Usually solitary (occasionally several) on living or recently dead hard woods or rarely conifers; fruiting mostly in the summer and fall but occurring year-round, widely distributed. It is a destructive parasite of oak and walnut (causing a white rot of the heart-wood), but occurs on a wide range of other trees, including mulberry and willow. The fruiting bodies usually emerge from the wounds of trees, often at a considerable distance from the ground. I have not seen this species locally but it occurs in southern California. EDIBILITY Unknown. "
"Genus: Inonotus
Species: tomentosus
Common_Name: N/A
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY usually terrestrial with a cap and a short or rudimentary stalk, but sometimes lacking a stalk and growing shelf-like on wood. CAP 3-12 (18) cm broad, circular to fan-shaped in outline, convex to plane to centrally depressed; surface dry, soft and hairy (tomentose) or velvety, whitish when very young but soon yellowish-brown to tan, dull ochre, brown, or rusty-brown, sometimes with faint concentric zones. Flesh yellow-brown to brown, duplex: upper layer soft and spongy when fresh, lower layer rather thin, firm, and fibrous. PORES round to angular or irregular becoming torn or sometimes toothlike in age, 24 per mm, pale buff to grayish or beige or becoming brownish, but often with a hoary sheen or surface covering; darker brown where bruised; tubes 1.5-7 mm long, usually decurrent. STALK often rudimentary, when present short (1-5 cm long), 0.5-2 cm thick, central to off-center or lateral, continuous with cap and more or less same color and texture, or darker. SPORE_PRINT pale yellow to pale brown; spores 4.5-7 x 2.54 microns, elliptical, smooth, hyaline under the microscope. Brown sterile cells (setae) abundant among basidia, straight and pointed. Cap tissue blackening in KOH (sometimes with a fleeting red intermediate phase). HABITAT Solitary or in groups on ground under conifers (presumably arising from roots or buried wood), sometimes also on stumps or bases of trunks; widely distributed. In our area it is fairly common throughout the mushroom season, especially in coastal pine forests. It causes a white pocket rot of the roots and butt of a wide variety of conifers in the pine family, but is especially fond of pine and spruce. EDIBILITY Unknown, but too tough to be of value. "
"Genus: Phaeolus
Species: schweinitzii
Common_Name: Dyer's Polypore
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY usually compound, composed of several caps arising in tiers from a common base, but sometimes simple (with one cap) and sometimes growing shelf-like on wood. CAP(s) 5-30 or more cm broad, circular to fan-shaped in outline; cushion-shaped becoming plane or depressed; soft and spongy when fresh and often knobby when actively growing, tough or corky in age, rigid and brittle when dry; surface covered with a dense felty or woolly mat of hairs, smoother in age; color variable: orange to ochraceous to yellowish or greenish-yellow (especially on the margin) when growing, becoming rusty-brown to dark brown in age (or from the center outward); staining brown to blackish when bruised and becoming entirely dark brown to blackish in old age; sometimes concentrically zoned with several of above colors; margin often wavy. Flesh yellowish to rusty-brown or brown, often appearing zoned. PORES 1-3 per mm or fused together to form larger pores; mustard-yellow to greenish when fresh, but quickly becoming brown or blackish when bruised or in age; tubes 2-10 mm long, usually decurrent. STALK(ifpresent) 1-6 cmlong and 1-5 cm thick, usually tapered downward, often rooting, central or off-center, same color and texture as cap. SPORE_PRINT white or tinged yellow to green; spores 5-9 x 3.5-5 microns, elliptical, smooth. Setae absent. Cap surface and tissue staining black in KOH, often with a fleeting cherry-red intermediate phase. HABITAT Solitary or in groups on or around dead and living conifers, usually but not always appearing terrestrial (originating from the roots); widely distributed and very common throughout the West. In our area it favors pine and Douglas-fir, the fruiting bodies usually appearing after the first fall rains but persisting year-round. The mycelium attacks the roots and heartwood of its host, causing a serious carbonizing decay known as ""red-brown butt rot."" It fractures the wood into cubical blacks as high as fifteen feet up the trunk, weakening the tree so that it blows over easily. It also occurs on coniferous slash, in which case it is more apt to be shelf-like than terrestrial. In the West it is one ofthe two or three most prevalent brown rot fungi. There is one report of it growing on eucalyptus. EDIBILITY Possibly poisonous. It contains a stimulant found in the roots ofthe kava kava plant, but apparently some toxic substances as well. It is too tough and hairy to be of food value anyway. However, it is prized by dye-makers for the rich and varied hues it imparts to yarn. "

PORES large (1-3 mm or more in diameter), angular, the walls often jagged or splitting to form ""teeth""; whitish or yellowish soon becoming orange (or tubes orange with white edges); tubes long (1-3 cm). STALK absent. SPORE_PRINT white; spores (7) 10-14 x 34 microns, cylindrical, smooth. Flesh reddening in KOH. HABITAT on fallen logs of conifers, usually on the undersides and often developing in snow; common in the subalpine forests of the West, fruiting mainly in the spring but persisting into summer, fall, or even winter. It is quite common in the southern Rocky Mountains, and I have also seen it in the Sierra Nevada. It prod uces a brown rot (carbon-izing decay) and is said to occasionally occur on aspen. EDIBILITY Unknown. "
"Genus: Laetiporus
Species: sulphureus
Common_Name: Sulfur Shelf; Chicken of the Woods
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY annual, emerging kno blike or fingerlike, soon becoming shelf-like; soft and fleshy when young, tough in age. CAP 5-50 (70) cm broad and up to 4 cm thick, fan-shaped to elongated or semi-circular in outline; surface smooth to suede like, often uneven or wrinkled; red-orange to bright orange, yellow-orange, sulfur-yellow, or salmon (the margin usually yellow), fading slowly with age to yellowish, buff, or eventually dull whitish; margin at first thick and blunt. Flesh thick, soft and watery when very fresh, becoming tough and eventually crumbly; white to pale yellow or salmon-tinged; when very fresh often exuding yellow or orange droplets and reminiscent of uncooked chicken; odor fungal or rather pungent; taste nearly mild or acidic becoming quite sour or un-pleasant in age. PORES 2-4 per mm but barely visible when young, bright sulfur-yellow, but often darkening when bruised and fading slowly in age; tubes shallow (1-4 mm long). STALK absent or present only as a narrowed base. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 5-7 x 3.5-5 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, smooth. HABITAT Solitary or more often in overlapping clusters or shelving masses on dead stum ps and logs, sometimes also on living trees or sometimes growing in rosettes from roots or buried wood; usually appearing on the same stumps year after year; widely distributed and common. In our area it fruits mainly in the late summer and fall, but old fruiting bodies may persist for months. It grows on a wide range of hardwoods and conifers. In coastal California it favors eucalyptus (September-October, ushering in the new mushroom season) and to a lesser extent conifers and oaks (N ovember-December). In the Sierra Nevada it is common on fir in the summer; in eastern North America it favors oak. It causes a destructive red-brown carbonizing heart rot that eventually hollows out the tree, producing cracks in the wood in which thin sheets of white mycelium may appear. It is said to have caused considerable damage to British sailing vessels. EDIBILITY Edible and delectable when thoroughly cooked. However, there have been several cases of sulfur shelf poisoning on the west coast, so try it cautiously the first time and never eat it raw. When young the succulent flesh has a mild flavor, tofu-like texture, and ..Candy Corn""-like color, making it especially attractive and delicious in omelets. Maturing specimens are tougher and develop a strong sour flavor; their texture when cooked is reminiscent of white chicken meat, so they're good in sandwiches. If the specimens you find are mature (but not so old as to be asbestos-like)"" you can trim offthe tender, rapidly growing margin (about 5 cm), and perhaps return later for more! "

CAP 5-75 cm broad or more, 2-20 cm thick, usually fan-shaped or semi-circular in outline, with a hard surface crust that is usually cracked, furrowed, ridged, andlor lumpy or knobby in age, but not varnished; surface gray to brown or grayish-brown, sometimes aging grayish-black, but often covered with brown to cocoa-brown spore powder. Flesh punky or corky, 0.5-5 cm thick, brown or cinnamon-brown, rarely whitish. PORES barely visible (4-6 per mm), white or whitish when fresh but instantly turning brown when scratched; often dingy yellowish to brown when dried or in old age; tube layers distinctly stratified and separated by a thin layer of chocolate-brown tissue; each tube layer 4-12 or more mm deep. STALK usually absent. SPORE_PRINT brown or reddish-brown; spores 6-9.5x 4.5-7 microns, broadly elliptical to slightly truncate at apex, thick-walled, appearing minutely spiny. HABITAT Solitary or in groups on hardwood logs and stumps, or growing from wounds in living trees (usually near the ground); also common on conifers in some areas. Very widely distributed, found year-round. Its hosts include virtually every hardwood found in North America, plus numerous conifers. In coastal California it(and close relatives-see comments) is especially common on bay laurel, but can also be found on oak, magnolia, pepper trees, acacia, eucalyptus, elm, and Douglas-fir. Along with F omitopsis pinicola. it is the commonest conk in our area. The only regions where it seems to be absent are those where there aren't any trees! It usually attacks dead ordyingtrees, but can also be parasitic, producing a whitish, delignifying decay ofthe sapwood and heartwood. Infected trees blow over easily, so if one appears on a tree near your house-watch out! EDIBILITY Much too tough and woody to be worthwhile (see edibility of Fomitopsis pinicola); however, sturdy specimens can be made into stools. "

CAP 2-20 (35) cm broad, 4-8 cm thick, circular to semi-circular to fan-shaped or kidney-shapedshaped in outline; surface usually with a varnished (shiny) surface crust, smooth or often concentrically zoned and grooved; color variable: dark red to reddish-brown, orange-brown, mahogany, or reddish-black, but often ochre or yellowish toward the margin (which is often white when actively growing); surface sometimes covered with brownish spore powder. Flesh ochra-ceo us-brown to dark brown, or pallid near the cap and brownish near the tubes; soft-corky or punky when fresh, tough when dry or old. PORES minute (4-7 per mm), whitish or yellowish-white when fresh, usually bruising or aging brown; tubes 2-20 mm long, one layer only (rarely two). STALK sometimes absent, but often present; usually attached laterally, but often vertical and well-developed, 3-14 cm long, 0.5-3 (4) cm thick; often gnarled or twisted, equal or enlarged below; dark red to reddish-black and appearing varnished like the cap. SPORE_PRINT brown; spores 7-13 x 5-8 microns, elliptical, double-walled, appearing minutely roughened. HABITAT Solitary or in small groups at bases of living hardwoods or on stumps and roots, very rarely on conifers; fruiting during mushroom season but often persisting year-round. Distribution worldwide-in both the tropical and temperate zones, from Canada to Argentina and Europe to Siberia, China, India, Australia, and Africa. It is fairly common in eastern North America but rather infrequent in California. It occurs on a wide 577 578 POL YPORACEAE & ALLIES range of hosts, but in North America is partial to maple. The very similar G. tsugae and G. oregonense occur on conifers (see comments). It is sometimes parasitic, but can also be saprophytic, producing a wet white rot in its host. EDIBILITY Too tough to be edible, but in the orient it is pictured in many classical art works and has been revered for centuries as a symbol of success and well-being (Ling Chih means"" marvelous herb"" or""mushroom of immortality""). It has been used in the treatment of cancer and various other maladies, and is believed by some to have the power of arousing the dead. one method of preparation is to soak the fruiting body in wine for several months. The resulting liquid ""essence"" or elixir is then drunk or put into candies. The varnished fruiting bodies are also used for decorative purposes. "

CAP 540 (75) cm broad, 3-22 cm thick, usually fan-shaped to semi-circular in outline; surface developing a thin, hard, resinous crust in age which is sometimes slightly varnished; usually at least partially reddish to dark red, but sometimes brown and often rusty or blackish-brown toward the base and brightly colored (white, yellow, ochraceous, or reddish) at the margin; concentrically furrowed andlor zoned in age; growing margin rounded, thick, and blunt. Flesh corky or woody, very tough, white to pinkish-buff or yellow when young, pale brownish or straw-colored in old age; usually bruising pinkish when actively growing; odor when fresh rather strong and fungal. PORES minute (3-5 per mm), white or pale yellow becoming brownish in old age; not turning brown when scratched but sometimes bruising yellow or pinkish-lilac; tube layers distinctly stratified, each layer 2-8 mm deep. STALK typically absent. SPORE_PRINT white or pale yellowish; spores 5-8 x 3.5-5 microns, cylindrical to elliptical, smooth. Flesh staining reddish to dark reddish-brown in KOH. HABITAT Solitary or in groups on dead trees, logs, and stumps or rarely on living trees, perennial; very common and widely distributed. It has been recorded from a wide range of hosts but is found mainly on conifers (in our area primarily Douglas-fir and redwood). It attacks both the heartwood and sapwood of its host, producing a slow carbonizing rot which fractures the wood and turns it brown (""brown crumbly rot""). Large mycelial mats can often be seen in the fractured wood. EDIBILITY This woody conk is not often eaten, but in a pinch you can use the following recipe developed by my wife: ""Saw into 2-inch cubes, then marinate in olive oil and dandelion wine for at least 48 hours (be sure to use LOTS of garlic!). Roast slowly on skewers over charcoal indefinitely (minimum time: 20 hours). Cool. Pound vigorously with a large mallet between two pieces of thick leather. Pulverize in a meat grinder and then force through a braced sieve (allow several hours for this step). Wrap the resulting mess in several thicknesses of cheesecloth and hang up someplace high and out of the way (on a clothesline or TV antenna). Allow to dangle thus for at least one week. (Aging has a mellowing effect, so you may want to try one year.) Wring periodically, making sure to reserve the drippings for gravy or as a motor oil additive. To eat, boil for twenty-four hours, squeeze thoroughly, garnish with gravel, and serve forth."" "

Flesh thick, white, cheesy when young but chalky or friable (crumbly) in mature or old specimens; odor farinaceous; taste very bitter. PORES 34 per mm, white or whitish when fresh, discoloring in age or drying; tube layers each 3-20 mm long, often stratified. STALK absent. SPORE_PRINT whitish; spores 4-5.5 x 34 microns, broadly elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Solitary or several on living and dead conifers; common year-round throughout much of the West, especially on larch and pine, but also on spruce, fir, hemlock, and Douglas-fir. It apparently does not occur in our area, but I have seen it on sugar pine and ponderosa pine on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada. It is said to be one of the three major destroyers of standing coniferous timber in the West (Phellinus pini and Phaeolus schweinitz;; are the other two). It causes ""felted heart rot,"" an extensive carbonizing trunk rot with thick mycelial mats often several feet long. EDIBILITY Friable but not fryable-it is inedible due to the bitter taste and tough texture, but has been used as a laxative and quinine substitute. (It does not have anti-malarial properties, but was thought to because of its taste.) Since the fruiting bodies often grow high above the ground, commercial ""quinine"" collectors used to dislodge them with rifles. "
