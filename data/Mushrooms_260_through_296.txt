Common_Name: California Agaricus
Group?: No
CAP 3-9 (12) cm broad, at first convex or marshmallow-shaped, the margin inrolled and often somewhat lobed, then expanding to broadly convex or plane or broadly umbonate; surface dry, smooth or with fibrils or small scales; color variable: most often white to silvery gray with a brown center, but sometimes entirely white and at other times with brown to grayish-brown fibrils or scales throughout; usually darker in age and often with a metallic luster; often pinkish-stained or reddish-stained in wet weather; margin often extending beyond gills. Flesh thick, white, unchanging or staining slightly yellowish when crushed, then eventually sordid reddish or brown; odor of crushed flesh phenolic but often faint. GILLS close, free at maturity, usually pallid until the veil breaks, then bright pink to pinkish-brown, finally chocolate-brown to blackish-brown. STALK 3-8 (12) cm long, 0.5-1 (1.5) cm thick, equal or slightly enlarged at base, stuffed or hollow, smooth, without scales; white, but often discoloring pinkish to dingy brown in age or after handling. VEIL membranous, thick, white, often with felty patches on underside; forming a persistent, superior to median ring on stalk or occasionally clinging to cap margin; ring skirtlike or intermediate. SPORE_PRINT chocolate-brown; spores 5-7 x 4-5 microns, elliptical, smooth. Cap surface staining yellow in KGH. HABITAT Solitary to scattered or densely gregarious (but not often in rings) on ground, growing anywhere and everywhere, but especially abundant in suburbia-on lawns, in gardens, parks, under trees (eucalyptus, acacia, oak, cypress, etc.), also in the woods, but only rarely in pastures (except under trees). Found year-round in our area, but most abundant in the fall, when it often mingles with Lepiota naucina and other Agaricus species. It is known only from the west coast, but may very well have a wider distribution. EDIBILITY Mildly poisonous to some people (causing stomach upsets), and frequently mistaken for the common meadow mushom (A. campestris), with which it often grows. "

Abundant in our area from fall through spring and even showing up in the summer. I have seen stupendous fruitings in an old olive orchard, under acacia and eucalyptus, and in numerous cypress plantations as well as with oak. EDIBILITY Poisonous to many people-causing headaches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It is a very tempting, meaty mushroom but the unpleasant odor becomes unbearably obnoxious when the mushroom is cooked, and the taste is awful as well. Yet there is no accounting for taste.

HABITAT Solitary to scattered or in groups or rings in pastures, lawns, and other grassy areas; distribution uncertain, but extremely abundant at times in our coastal pastures (when they are ""popping"" it is not unusual to pick 100 pounds from a single pasture-along with some giant puffballs!) There is usually one crop in the fall and another, larger one in the spring, but it is also to be expected during warm spells in the winter. Its rangeextendsat least into northern California and oregon, where the very similar A. crocodilinus (see comments) is also common. EDIBILITY Edible (for most people), and very popular with my group of acquaintances.

SPORE_PRINT chocolate-brown; spores 5.5-7 x 4-5 microns, elliptical, smooth. Cap surface staining yellow in KGH. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious or clustered in compost, manure, and rich soil; originally described from eastern North America and apparently widely distributed, but rare. I have seen it fruit by the hundreds in manure-filled trenches on a berry farm near Watsonville, California, in the late spring, summer, and early fall (sometimes accom-panied by Lepiota lutea and L. americana). It is easily grown at home in a vegetable garden (if you use compost) and mycelium from thejust-described ""patch"" is now being marketed for this purpose. It has the advantage ofliking it hot, meaning you can enjoy it at the same time as your other summer vegetables (A. bisporus is also grown easily in gardens, but likes it much cooler). EDIBILITY Edible (for most people) and delicious! The almondy odor and taste is much stronger than that of A. augustus-so strong, in fact, that some people don't care for it. I put several specimens in a cream-of-mushroom soup and those who tasted it swore I had dumped in a bottle of almond extract! It was apparently cultivated around the turn of the century, but lost out to A. bisporus-which raises an interesting prospect: if it had become the ""cultivated mushroom"" instead of A. bisporus, would the word ""mushroomy"" have a completely different (sweet and almondy) connotation?

It shows a definite preference for warm weather, fruiting in the spring, summer, and fall-or in the winter if it's mild enough. Several crops are prod uced each year, so visit your patches regularly. It is curious that such a large mushroom requires so little moisture to fruit-a little fogdrip is all it needs! EDIBILITY Edible (for most people) and one of the very best! It's especially significant beca use it fruits in the spring and summer, when edible fungi are scarce in our area. It's like getting two mushrooms in one: delectably sweet and almondy when young, strong and mushroomy at maturity. Unfortunately maggots, slugs, sowbugs, and centipedes are fond of it too! "

In our area the major crop is in the fall or early winter, but it can be found most any time, In the Southwest I have seen troops of them crowding highway shoulders for miles-both in the spring and fall. For some reason ""shags"" seem to gravitate toward asphalt and often burst up through it. They've been known to ruin tennis courts, and one is reported to have lifted a 10 pound slab of concrete in a heroic attempt to proliferate its species. Alexander Smith describes a fruiting of over 1000 specimens on a baseball field, ""extending in a line from first base to short left field."" EDIBILITY Edible and delicious-one of the best known and safest of all wild mush-rooms. The flavor is very delicate but the texture is marvelous-not slimy as in okra, but succulent as in octopus. For a delicious snack, slice them in half and dip them in egg batter and bread crumbs (or flour), then saute them briefly and serve hot! Use only young caps-darkened ones are mostly water-and don't pick more than you can eat in two meals unless you plan to preserve them, for they will deliquesce quickly.

It used to be an unwanted intruder in cultivated mushroom beds, and is one of our characteristic ""suburban"" mushrooms. The largest fruiting I've seen in the wild was under aspen in New Mexico. Several crops are generally produced each year. EDIBILITY Edible when young and fairly good-but sometimes reacting with alcohol in the body to produce a peculiar type of poisoning (see p. 896 for details). The grayish-brown caps look rather unappetizing-and precisely for this reason were the very first wild mushroom I ventured to eat.

HABITAT Scattered to gregarious on dung (especially of horses), manure, and straw; widely distributed. In my experience it is not particularly common, but often prolific when it fruits. I have seen large numbers near Saratoga, California, in January, and near Flagstaff, Arizona, in September. O.K. Miller says it is common during the summer in Alaska and the Yukon. EDIBILITY Edible. I haven't tried it, but McIlvaine says, ""it is one of the best of the toadstools."" The relatively large size makes it the only non-hallucinogenic Panaeolus worth eating. "

VEIL absent. SPORE_PRINT black; spores 10-14 x 7-9 microns, elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious-often in small clumps-in manure, com-post, and fertilized lawns; widely distributed. In our area it fruits practically year-round but is most common in warm weather. I've seen several hundred specimens in a garden overgrown with vetch and mulched with compost from a mushroom farm. (It is one of the major mushroom ""weeds"" in cultivated mushroom beds.) EDIBILITY Hallucinogenic-the psilocybin content varies from moderate to low, perhaps due to differences in the nitrogen concentration of the substrate. A middle-aged Santa Cruz woman who mistook them for cultivated mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) was hospitalized with hallucinations (a frightening experience if you're unprepared for them!), but recovered shortly.

In contrast to most Panaeolus species, it doesn't grow on dung, and in our area it doesn't even seem to grow in pastures. EDIBILITY Harmless in small quantities, but potentially poisonous to toddlers in the ""grazing"" stage, since chemical analysis has revealed traces of psilocybin in some collections.
