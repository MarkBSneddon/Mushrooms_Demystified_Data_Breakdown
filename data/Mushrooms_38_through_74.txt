Gill tissue paralleL HABITAT Solitary to scattered or gregarious on ground in damp places (usually in woods); widely distributed and very common, but rarely fruiting in large numbers. It is known from a wide variety of habitats in North America, but in our area shows a pro-nounced preference for redwood and cypress. It fruits in the fall and winter and, along with H. acutoconica, is usually the first of the brightly colored waxy caps to appear. Bob Winter says it often grows on lawns in Fresno, California. EDIBILITY Not recommended. It was once considered poisonous, perhaps due to its blackening qualities, but also because four deaths in China were (mistakenly?) attributed to it. Now it's generally regarded as harmless, but Larry Stickney, chef eXlra ordina ire, meandering mainstay of the Mycological Society of San Francisco, and an inimitable mushroom-loving marvel of a man, says it ""elicited an odd sensation of lightheadedness and numbness"" when he tried it.

Common_Name: Subalpine Waxy Cap
Group?: No
CAP 4-15 (25) cm broad, broadly convex becoming plane or slightly depressed; surface viscid when moist but soon dry, smooth, pure white or developing a slight yellowish tinge in age; margin sometimes with veil remnants. Flesh thick, firm at first but soft in age, white; odor and taste mild. GILLS white when young, often creamy or tinged dingy yellowish in age; typically adnate to decurrent, narrow, close, soft andlor waxy. STALK 3-10 cm long, 1-5 (7) cm thick at apex, usually thick and stout, often with a rounded basal bulb when young (but often more or less equal in age); firm, dry, solid, white. VEIL somewhat membranous, disappearing or forming a narrow, flaring or flange-like, median to inferior ring on the stalk (just above the bulb). SPORE_PRINT white; spores 8-10 x 4.5-6 microns, elliptical, smooth. Gill tissue divergent. HABITAT Solitary to gregarious on ground under conifers; known only from the mountains of western North America. It is a common ""snowbank"" species in the Sierra Nevada, Cascades, and Rocky Mountains, but also appears in the summer and late fall. I have yet to find it on the coast. EDIBILITY Deer consider it a delicacy; I don't. Although tempting because of its robustness and penchant for growin in the spring when there are few edible agarics out and about, it decays quickly and does not have the greatest texture and flavor (see com-ments on edibility of H. sordidus).

Common_Name: Sordid Waxy Cap
Group?: No
CAP 5-20 cm broad or more, convex becoming plane or with uplifted margin; surface smooth, viscid when moist but not often slimy and soon dry; white or sometimes tinged yellowish-buff at center; margin at first inrolled. Flesh thick, firm, white. GILLS adnate to decurrent, soft but only slightly waxy; white, sometimes dingy yellowish in age. STALK 6-10 cm long, 1.5-4 cm thick, equal or narrowed at base, solid, smooth, firm, white, not viscid. VEIL absent. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 6-8 x 4-5.5 microns, elliptical, smooth. Gill tissue divergent. HABITAT Solitary to widely scattered or gregarious on ground in woods, associated principally (if not exclusively) with oaks, widespread but primarily southern. In our area it fruits with live oak in the fall and winter. It is quite abundant some years, but almost completely absent others. EDIBILITY Edible but not choice. I ruined an otherwise superb curry in my sole attempt to make it palatable. The sliced caps neither absorbed the surrounding spices nor contributed any special flavor of their own. The turmeric did turn them yellow, however, making them look for all the world like undercooked and overfed banana slugs-gummy, amorphous masses of slime that coagulated around or completely engulfed the peas and savory chunks of potato, rendering the entire dish inedible (though unforgettable). Since its attractive appearance belies its ""slugulose"" qualities, I can only conclude that the scientific soul who named it had a similar and equally sordid experience with it. "
"Genus: Hygrophorus
Species: russula
Common_Name: Russula-Like Waxy Cap
Group?: No
CAP 5-13 cm broad, convex to plane or with uplifted margin in age; surface viscid when wet but soon dry; coral-pink to vinaceous-red, usually streaked with purple-red or vinaceous fibrils; smooth or minutely scaly, occasionally staining yellowish when rubbed or in age; margin often paler or whitish and incurved when young. Flesh thick, white or tinged pink; odor and taste typically mild. GILLS usually adnate but sometimes adnexed or slightly decurrent, close to crowded (120-150 reach the stalk), soft, slightly waxy; white at first but soon flushed pink and developing purple-red to vinaceous stains in age. STALK 3-10 cm long, 1.5-3.5 cm thick, usually rather stout; solid, dry, smooth, equal or tapered below; white, soon stained or streaked pink to reddish or vinaceous. VEIL absent. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 6-8 x 3-5 microns, elliptical, smooth. Gill tissue slightly divergent. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious or in rings in mixed woods and under hardwoods, associated mainly with oaks; widely distributed and common in eastern North America, but infrequent on the west coast. In our area I find it occasionally in the late fall and early winter in tanoak-madrone woods at higher elevations in the coastal mountains. EDIBILITY Edible and choice, according to some, but my lingering distaste for fleshy waxy caps (see comments on edibility of H. sordidus) has discouraged me from sampling it. one authority calls it ""the best of the family for the table""-a classic example of damning with faint praise, if you ask me. on the other hand, local Hygrophorus-hound Luen Miller, who suffers from an acute case of""McIlvaine-mania,""* says of H. russula: ""N ot as good as H. sordidus, but as an edible species it is not to be despised. It has a noble waxy texture and makes a toothsome meal. Although it lacks the supreme succulence of H. sordidus, it largely makes up for it in possessing a copious supply of wax, which coats the mouth and throat for hours after eating it, the way good ice cream does. All authorities pronounce it excellent. It is delightful scalloped or stewed, or better yet, made into catchu p and poured over food. The Tartars, I am told, know it as 'poor man's candle' since the dried 'carps offer a weak flickering flame when lit."" .See footnote on p. 419! "

Group?: No
CAP 5-15 (20) cm broad, obtuse or convex with an inrolled margin, becoming broadly convex or plane in age; surface smooth, viscid when moist, pale tan to pinkish or flesh-color, or pinkish-stained orange toward the center and pinker or paler at the margin.

VEIL absent. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 6.5-9.5 x 4-5.5 microns, elliptical, smooth. Gill tissue divergent. HABITAT Scattered or in groups on ground under conifers, particularly spruce; widely distributed but erratic in its fruiting habits. It does not occur in our area (probably due to the absence of spruce), but [ have seen large fruitings in December with Sitka spruce in northern California, and in August with Engelmann spruce in the Southwest. EDIBILITY Edible but mediocre. Some variants are said to have a ""turpentine-like taste,"" but I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this comparison, since [ have never tasted tur-pentine. (Have you?) "
