SPORE_PRINT white; spores 7-12x 6-9 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, smooth, amyloid. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups or troops in woods or on lawns near trees; widely distributed. In our area it is very common under live oak in the fall and early winter and may even turn up in the summer if moisture is sufficient. In the late winter and spring, however, it is largely supplanted by A. ocreata. Perhaps an adventitious (but hardly advantageous!) introduction from Europe, it has taken a fancy to our native oaks and spread like the plague, so that it is now the most abundant Amanita of our live oak woodlands. Heavy fall rains often elicit a stupendous crop-I have counted as many as one hundred specimens under a single oak! I've never seen it growing without live oak in the vicinity, but in southern oregon it grows with other oaks and in eastern North America it has turned up in numerous localities under conifers as well as hard woods. Apparently it can form mycorrhiza with a wide range of hosts! EDIBILITY DEADLY POISONOUS! Learn to recognize this species before eating any mushroom with gills! It is particularly dangerous because the symptoms are delayed, not appearing for from 6 to 24 hours after ingestion, by which time there is relatively little modern medicine can do except to treat the victim symptomatically. In the last decade there have been one or two deaths in California every time a bumper crop has appeared. However, none of the victims were knowledgeable fungophiles, let alone ""mushroom experts"" (as they are often called by the press). The flavor, incidentally, is described by survivors as excellent-despite the awful odor which develops in old specimens. For an account of symptoms and treatment, see pp. 892-893. "

Related ""destroying angels"" are abun-dant under hardwoods and conifers in eastern North America, and to a lesser extent, the Pacific Northwest (see comments). EDIBILITY DEADLY POISONOUS! It doesn't enjoy the same notoriety as A. phal-loides, but is just as dangerous, and in some regions (such as southern California), it is the more common of the two. It recently caused several deaths near San Diego. The victims were apparently starving illegal aliens who ate the mushrooms out of desperation. "

PAR TIAL V ElL membranous, white or pale yellow above, bright yellow to grayish-yellow on underside; forming a superior, skirt-like ring on stalk. UNIVERSAL_VEIL powdery, friable, forming a scaly volva (scaly zones andlor yellow to grayish-yellow powdery scales) at base of stalk, but volva easily obliterated. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 8-12 x 6-8 microns, elliptical, smooth, amyloid. HABITAT Solitary to scattered or in small groups under both hardwoods and conifers; common in our area and throughout the Pacific Northwest, but seldom in large numbers. It often grows with A. muscaria in our coastal pine forests and the two make a colorful pair; it is also frequent in our oak-madrone woodlands. Rather than fruiting in one large, spectacular burst like A. calyptrata and A. muscaria, it usually keeps a lower profile, fruit-ing rather sporadically throughout the mushroom season. EDIBILITY To be avoided. Chemical analysis has failed to reveal the presence of amanita-toxins, but this does not mean it is edible. True, the European form is edible (according to one source), and if ourform were poisonous we would probably know by now-but why tempt fate when there are so many other safe, savory mushrooms available?

CAP 5-30 (40) cm broad, round becoming convex and finally plane or slightly depressed; surface viscid when moist, color variable: bright red to blood-red, scarlet-red, or orange-red when fresh (var. muscaria and var. flavivolvata), but often fading to orange, yellow-orange, or paler; bright yellow-orange to yellow, then fading (var.formosa); yellow with a peachy center (var. persicina); or white to buff to silvery-grayish-white(var. alba); covered at first with a dense coating of universal veil fragments (warts) which are usually white(but are yellow in var. flavivolvata and often buff or tan in var. alba); warts flattened in age, often wearing away or washed off by rain; margin usually at least somewhat striate. Flesh firm when young, soft inage; thick, white. GILLS adnate to adnexed or free, close, broad, white. STALK 5-20 (30) cm long, 1-3 (4) cm thick at apex, tapering upward or equal with a basal bulb up to 6 cm broad; white or whitish, or somewhat discolored in age; smooth or somewhat ragged-scaly below the ring; often fragile in old age. PARTIAL_VEIL membranous, usually forming a thin, persistent, median to superior, skirtlike ring on stalk which may collapse in age; ring white or with yellow patches, margin often torn or toothed. UNIVERSAL_VEIL friable, forming a scaly volva at apex of bulb consisting of one or more (usually 24) concentric rings. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 9-13 x 6.5-9 microns, broadly elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Solitary or scattered to densely gregarious or in large rings in forests and at their edges, also with planted trees. Common throughout most of the northern hemisphere-its fa vorite mycorrhizal mates include pine, spruce, fir, birch, and aspen. The bright red form with white warts (vaL muscaria) is the common one in western North America as well as Europe and Asia. In our area it fruits along with the yellow-warted variety from fall to early spring and is often abundant in our coastal pine forests and along freeways where pines have been planted. It also turns up occasionally under oak and madrone. In the Rocky Mountains it is common in late summer with spruce and in the Pacific Northwest in the fall with various conifers. The red-capped form with yellow warts (vaL j7avivolvala) has a southern distribution but is quite common in our area. The form with a bright yellow to yellow-orange cap (vaLjurmu:m) is the dominant one in eastern North America. In California it iscommonin the Sierra Nevada but ratherrarein the Coast ranges. The grayish-white form (var. alba) is more common in northern regions. It has been found in northern California, but is rare. The peach-centered variety (var. persicina) is most common in the Southeast. It is interesting to note that wherever A. muscaria grows it is often accompanied by Boletus edulis. and can serve as a ""red flag"" indicator for that species. I've even seen a very large ring of A. muscaria locally that numbered over 100 fruiting bodies, with three bulky B. edulis growing right in the middle of it! EDIBILITY Poisonous and hallucinogenic-esteemed by both maggots and mystics. Fatalities are extremely rare, but it is undoubtedly dangerous in large or even moderate amounts. The effects vary from person to person, mushroom to mushroom, and from region to region and season to season, so that there is no way to determine in advance what one's reaction will be. Too many people have had unpleasant experiences for me to recommend it (for an account of its effects, see p. 894). Tales of ""getting off' by nibbling on a piece of the veil or licking the ""stars"" off the cap are frivolous. However, the skin ap-parently contains greater concentrations of the toxins than the rest of the fruiting body. The name ..fly agaric,"" incidentally, is derived from the ancient practice of using the mush-room (often mixed with milk) to stupefy flies. It is also notable for its ability to concentrate vanadium-a rare, malleable, ductile metal used to add tensile strength to steel-from the soil. "

Flesh thick, yellow under the cuticle, otherwise white. GILLS close, broad, adnate to adnexed or free, bright chrome-yellow or at times egg-yellow, or pale yellow with darker yellow edges. STALK 5-15 (20) cm long, 1.5-3 cm thick, equal or slightly thicker below (but may appear bulbous from the thick volva); smooth or with small scales, same color as gills or slightly paler; stuffed with a pith or jelly, eventually hollow. PARTIAL_VEIL membranous, forming a persistent, superior and often striate, skirtlike ring which is colored like the gills. UNIVERSAL_VEIL thick, membranous, white, forming a large, rather tough, lobed, saclike volva which is attached only to the base of stalk and may have a flange within. SPORE_PRINT white or faintly yellow; spores 8-12x 6-8 microns, elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious or sometimes in large rings, in pine and oak woods in southern Europe and much ofthe warm temperate zone. Its North American distribution parallels that of Lactarius indigo: it is common in the summer under ponderosa pine in Arizona and New Mexico, as well as with various pines in Mexico and Central America, and a slightly different variety (see comments) occurs in the southeastern United States north to Quebec. It has not been recorded from California but is to be looked for in the warmer parts of the state (it is apparently supplanted by A. calyptrata). I have seen enormous fruitings near the Grand Canyon, in August and September. EDIBILITY Edible and highly prized in Europe, where it is considered among the very best of all mushrooms (it is said to have been a favorite of the Caesars). In America, however, it is not so highly regarded. Its flavor is very similar to that of A. calyptrata, which is to say, not to everyone's liking. Because of its brilliant color it is by far the safest ofthe Amanitas for the table (but not necessarily the best-see A. velosal). "
