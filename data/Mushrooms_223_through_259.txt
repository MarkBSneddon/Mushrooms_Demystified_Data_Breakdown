Common_Name: Coccora; Coccoli
Group?: No
CAP 7-25 cm or more broad, rounded becoming convex and finally plane; surface viscid when wet, usually with a large, thick, central, cottony whitish patch of universal veil tissue; otherwise typically dull orange to orange-brown, bronze, yellow-brown, or dark brown, usually with a paler (yellow) margin, or pale yellow to creamy or whitish (the pale form) or occasionally greenish; margin usually clearly striate. Flesh firm, thick, white or creamy; odor mild becoming slightly unpleasant in age. GILLS broad, close, adnate becoming adnexed or free, white to pale creamy-yellow. STALK 7-25 cmlong, 1-3.5 cm thick, equal or tapering upward, smooth, creamy to yellowish (typical form) or creamy to white (pale form) or white to greenish (greenish form); hollow, the cavity often filled with a cottony or jellylike substance. PARTIAL_VEIL membranous, colored like stalk or slightly darker, forming a large but fragile, superior, skirt like ring on stalk which is easily obliterated. UNIVERSAL_VEIL membranous, white, forming a large saclike volva that sheathes the stalk base; volva thick, ample, felty or cottony, often lobed, often with a collar or flange within. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 8-11 x 5-6 microns, elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Solitary to widely scattered or gregarious on ground in woods; known only from the west coast. The distribution of the typical (darker) form parallels that of its favorite mycorrhizal mate, madrone: it is common in northern California and southern oregon, where madrone is also common, less frequent in Washington, where madrone is likewise less numerous, then common again on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, where madrone is abundant. In our area it usually fruits after the first fall rains, sometimes in tremendous quantity. The pale form, on the other hand, is a late winter and spring mushroom. In our area it favors oak, but never fruits in the large quantities characteristic of the fall (typical) form. In the Sierra Nevada the pale form is prevalent under pine and other conifers, often forming ""mushrumps"" (especially in the spring). EDIBILITY Edible and popular, but with a rather strong, fishy fla vor tha t doesn't appeal to everyone. Too many people eat and enjoy the typical form for me not to recommend it. However, be absolutely sure of your identification, review the comments on pp. 264-265, and avoid the pale and greenish forms, which are easily confused with poisonous species (see photo on next page!). The caps are superb stuffed and then broiled. The hollow stems can be sliced crosswise(to make rings) and marinated. The flesh does not keep well, so use what you pick as soon as possible. Italian-Americans stalk it with a passion, undoubtedly because of its resemblance-in both appearance and flavor-to their beloved A. caesarea of Italy. ""Coccora,"" ""coccoli,"" and ""cocconi"" (another nickname) are presumably derived from an Italian word for cocoon-a very apt description ofthe large, soft, cottony ""eggs."" "

CAP 3-12 (15) cm broad, at first nearly oval, soon convex and finally plane; surface viscid when moist, smooth, pinkish-tan to orange-buff to salmon, beige, ""the color of a brown hen's egg,"" or sometimes much paler (even white), often fading; usually with a white patch of universal veil tissue or several large, thick pieces; margin distinctly striate. Flesh fairly thick, white, odor rather pungent in age. GILLS adnate to adnexed or free, close, white, sometimes dull pinkish in old age. STALK 5-12 (15) cm long, 0.5-1.5 (2.5) cm thick, equal or tapering upward; white or tinged cap color, apex often powdery or striate, lower portion smooth or broken into rings or scales. PARTIAL_VEIL usually absent, but a rudimentary ring (annulus) sometimes present as a cottony or fibrillose-scaly zone. UNIVERSAL_VEIL membranous, forming a saclike volva which sheathes the stalk base; volva white or tinged cap color, usually buried, ample but sometimes disintegrating or obscure. SPORE_PRINT white or tinged very slightly pinkish; spores 8.5-12.5 x 6-10 microns, nearly round to elliptical, smooth, not amyloid. HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious, common in winter and spring, associated in our area with live oak but often growing out in the open(in fields and around their edges, brushy areas, lawns, etc.), up to 40 feet away from its mycorrhizal host (which is often stunted by poor soil conditions). It also occurs in the aspen-conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada and with various oaks in the Sierra Nevada foothills and southern oregon. It is apparently endemic to the west coast and more common in our area than anywhere else. With A. rubescens and A. ocreala it forms a striking triumvirate of springtime Amanitas that are monogamous locally with live oak. It is interesting to note that when all three form mycorrhiza with the same tree, they frequently occupy distinctly different zones or niches: A. velosa typically grows in the open at the outer fringes of the host's roots; A. ocreala grows in deep shade near the trunk; and A. rubescens occupies the intermediate zone or ""shade border"" near the perimeter of the branche. EDIBILITY Edible and incredible! Most ""objective"" fungophiles rate it far superior to the better-known A. calyplrala and A. caesarea. At any rate, it is far sweeter. As a bonus, it fruits in the spring when there is a paucity of other collectable delectables. However, it is nol a good choice for beginners. Faded specimens should be avoided, as they are easily confused with A. ocreala and other poisonous Amanitas. "

Cap cuticle composed of narrow, interwoven, mostly repent hyphae (but often upright at center of cap). HABITAT Solitary to scattered or in groups or large rings on lawns and other grassy places, also in gardens; fruiting in summer or during warm weather and widely distributed in the tropics and warm temperate zone. It is common in most of eastern and southern North America as well as inland northern California. I have seen enormous fruitings on lawns in Fresno, Los Angeles, Palo Alto, and San Diego, but have never seen it on the central California coast, perhaps because of the cool summers. EDIBILITY Poisonous! Some people eat it without ill effect but many suffer severe gastrointestinal distress. It is probably the most common cause of mushroom poisoning in the United S ta tes, a tribute to its growth on la wns, tern pting size(it borders on being irresis-tible) and resemblance to LeplOta rachodes, Coprinus comatus, Agaricus species, etc. "

VEIL membranous, white or with a brown, ragged margin; forming a large, thick, collarlike, double-edged, superior ring on stalk which is usually movable in age. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 6-13 x 5-9 microns, elliptical, smooth, with a large apical pore, thick-walled, dextrinoid. Cap cuticle composed of enlarged, erect cells. HABITAT Usually in groups or rings on ground under trees (particularly conifers) and bushes, in gardens and compost piles, near stables, on ant hills, along roads and other disturbed places, even in basements and greenhouses, sometimes also in open fields or in the woods; widely distributed, but most common in western North America. It fruits whenever conditions are favorable, i.e. moist and mild, and often produces several crops a year. ""Patches"" are not particularly numerous, but can be very prolific-I've seen several hundred specimens under a single tree! Variety hortensis is quite common in our area, especially under planted conifers (e.g., cypress) and in sandy soil along the coast (I have found it on Ano Nuevo Island in sand and elephant seal dung, and in the splash zone at Pebble Beach!). The typical variety is more common in the Pacific Northwest. EDIBILITY Edible and excellent, with caution. A number of people have had severe ""allergic"" reactions to it, particularly on the west coast, and it is easily confused with Chlorophyllum molybdites. It has an exceptionally strong, nutty flavor but the water content is high. For the best and safest results, fry it on high heat in an open pan. Delicious! "

Group?: No
CAP 2-8 cm broad, oval or bell-shaped becoming convex to nearly plane with a low, broad umbo; surface dry, soon breaking up into yellow-brown or brown scales except for the smooth, darker center; often yellower toward margin, which is soft and ragged from cottony veil remnants. Flesh white, not staining appreciably; odor sometimes pungent. GILLS free, close, white or creamy. STALK 4-12 (18) cm long, 3-7 (10) mm thick, usually slender and about equal, fragile; sheathed with soft, shaggy or cottony scales below the veil, usually yellow or colored like cap. VEIL cottony, leaving remnants on cap margin or a slight cottony-fibrillose ring on stalk. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 12-20x 4-6 microns, fusiform (elongated), smooth, dextrinoid. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in small groups in woods, widely distributed. In our area it favors conifers such as Douglas-fir, and is fairly common in the fall and winter. A related species or variant (see comments) occurs under oak in the winter and spring. EDIBILITY Said to be poisonous-all slender woodland Lepiotas are best avoided. "
"Genus: Agaricus
Species: campestris
Common_Name: Meadow Mushroom
Group?: No
CAP 4-11 (15) cm broad, convex or dome-shaped for a long time, then often becoming plane; surface dry, smooth or silky-fibrillose, pure white, or sometimes with a few grayish to brown or cinnamon-buff fibrils or fibrillose scales; margin extending beyond the gills, often hung with veil remnants. Flesh thick, white, not staining when bruised but sometimes discoloring brownish or reddish in age or wet weather (especially just above the gills); odor mild. GILLS close, free at maturity, pale pink in button stage, then bright pink, becoming purple-brown to chocolate-brown and finally blackish-brown. STALK 2-6 (10) cm long, 1-2.5 cm thick, usually with a tapered base; firm, white, smooth above the veil, often with a few fibrils below; stuffed or hollow (but see comments). VEIL thin, somewhat cottony, white, forming a thin ring on stalk or leaving remnants on cap margin or disappearing entirely; ring rarely well-formed, intermediate (sometimes flaring) or rarely skirtlike, median to superior. SPORE_PRINT chocolate-brown; spores 6.5-8.5 x 4-5.5 microns, elliptical, smooth. Cap surface not yellowing in KOH. Basidia mostly 4-spored. HABITAT As its name implies (campestre=field), this is a grassland species, occurring throughout the world from sea level to above timberline. It usually grows in groups or rings in lawns, pastures and meadows, cemeteries, golf courses, baseball fields, etc., but can also be solitary. It fruits practically year-round in our area, but is most abundant in the fall and early winter, when stupendous crops are sometimes produced in our pastures. Thou-sands of pounds, in fact, go unpicked every year. Though they can often be seen from the road, fungophobic Americans drive right by them, some undoubtedly on the way to the store to buy mushrooms! EDIBILITY Edible and excellent, both raw and cooked. It is the most widely picked mushroom in English-speaking countries (where it is also known as the ""pink-bottom""), and is the popular champignon of France. Those who equate it with the cultivated mush-room (A. bisporus) do it an injustice. Its flavor islar superior, though the texture is softer. When the gills are bright pink and the cap pure white, it is as beautiful as it is delicious. "

CAP 2-7 cm broad, convex becoming broadly convex to plane or slightly uplifted; surface dry, more or less tomentose (hairy) from a layer of small brown to grayish-or reddish-brown fibrils or fibrillose scales; margin usually extending beyond gills. Flesh white, rather soft and fragile, not staining when bruised but often discoloring reddish to brownish in old age or wet weather, especially just above the gills; odor mild. GILLS free at maturity, close, pale dingy pinkish in button stage, becoming pinkish-brown to purple-brown, then chocolate-brown to blackish-brown. STALK 2-4 cm long, 0.7-1.2 (2) cm thick, usually equal but sometimes thicker at either end; white, smooth above the veil, often somewhat scurfy or scaly below; hollow or stuffed. VEIL thin, white, somewhat cottony, forming a thin ring on stalk; ring more or less median, intermediate (sometimes flaring), well-formed or disappearing, sometimes with a slight second ring below it. SPORE_PRINT chocolate-brown; spores 7-9x 4-6.5 microns, elliptical, smooth. Cap surface not yellowing in KOH. Basidia mostly 4-spored. HABITAT Solitary to scattered or gregarious(often in rings) in pastures, lawns, and other grassy places, but showing a special affinity for poor soil; very common in California and probably widespread. In our area it fruits prolifically in the fall and early winter, often growing with and outnumbering A. campestris. EDIBILITY Edible. The flavor is comparable to that of A. campestris, but the texture is much softer and more fragile. Also, the buttons tend to develop underground, making it difficult to find specimens with pink gills. "

CAP 3-16 cm broad, convex when young, often plane or even slightly depressed in age; surface dry, in one form entirely white, but more often with flattened pale brown to brown fibrils which in age or dry weather often break up into fibrillose scales; margin inrolled when young, often extending beyond the gills. Flesh thick, very firm, white, usually (but not always) discoloring somewhat (brown to reddish or pinkish-stained orange) when cut and rubbed repeatedly; odor mild or faintly fruity. GILLS free at maturity, close, pinkish or pale brown when young, purple-brown to chocolate-brown in age, and finally blackish-brown. STALK 2-8 cm long, 1-3 (4) cm thick, usually stout, very firm, equal or enlarged at base; white or turning dingy brownish with age, smooth or slightly cottony-scaly below ring. VEIL membranous, cottony, white, two-layered, typically forming a delicate, median to superior ring on stalk which may collapse in age; ring intermediate or sometimes skirtlike, its upper surface often striate. SPORE_PRINT chocolate-brown; spores 5.5-8.5 x 4-6.5 microns, elliptical, smooth. Cap surface not yellowing in KOH. Basidia mostly 2-spored. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious or in clumps in compost and manure, rich soil, along paths and in gardens, and also very common under cypress, but only rarely found in woods or on lawns; very widely distributed. In our area it ""fruits"" year-round in markets. The major fruiting in the wild is typically in the fall or winter. EDIBILITY Edible-and if popular demand is any indication-choice (over a halfbil-lion pounds are cultivated annually in the United States!). However, as with any mass-produced agricultural product, flavor has been sacrificed for appearance, keeping quality, yield, and disease resistance. Pesticides are used, of course, and the result is, in Valentina Wasson's felicitous phrase, ""a sickly simulacrum"" of what a mushroom should be. The ""wild"" form is slightly better-especially the young, hard buttons. "

Flesh thick, very firm, white, not staining when bruised (but may discolor slightly); odor mild. GILLS close, free or nearly free; pallid, soon becoming grayish-pink, then deep reddish-brown to chocolate-brown, finally blackish-brown. STALK 2-10 (18) cm long, 1-3 (4) cm thick, very firm, solid, equal or slightly thicker below, but often with a narrowed or pointed base; white, without scales. VEIL membranous, white, thick, forming a prominent, persistent, more or less median (or even basal) ring on stalk; ring band like (upper edge free or flaring and lower edge free) or sheathlike (like a voIva, with only the upper edge free). SPORE_PRINT chocolate-brown; spores 5-7 x 4-5.5 microns, broadly elliptical, smooth. Cap surface not yellowing in KOH. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in grou,ps or rows on road shoulders, in hard-packed soil, along sidewalks, around playgrounds, and in other disturbed areas; often fruiting underground (looking for them can be like digging for clams!). Widely distributed but not common on the coast, where it is largely replaced by A. bernardii. I have heard of gigantic fruiting bodies (10 inch buttons!) of either this species or A. bernardii buried deep in alluvial soil in riverbeds in the Livermore-Pleasanton area of California. In colder regions A. bitorquis often appears along roads where salt is sprayed in the winter. In the Southwest it is often abundant along highways, but is hard to spot because of its subter-ranean habit. However, shaggy manes (Coprinus comatus), which are hard not to spot, are often an indicator of its pres,ence.ln our area I have found it in the fall, winter, and spring. EDIBILITY Edible, and in my fickle fungal opinion, the best of all Agaricus species. In Europe it is cultivated commercially because of its immunity to the virus disease that plagues A. bisporus. It is larger, meatier, and much firmer than either A. bisporus or A. campestris. one devotee goes so far as to say: ""Life is like an Agaricus bitorquis-all good except for a few gills."" Life may not be so consistently good, but A. bitorquis certainly is! "

HABITAT Solitary or scattered to densely gregarious in sand, sandy soil, disturbed areas, on lawns, and in various saline habitats; occurring along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in Europe. In our area it is quite common in the fall and winter, usually appearing after the first soaking rains. In Santa Monica, California, I have seen it in the summer on lawns. It apparently has an even greater tolerance (or liking) for salt than does A. bilorquis, and like that species, sometimes fruits underground.

HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious or clustered on ground under old cypresses (or occasionally other trees), or where cypresses have been cut down; known only from California. It is locally common in the fall and winter or whenever it is damp enough; I have seen large fruitings in Monterey and San Mateo counties. EDIBILITY Edible and choice! It is one of the meatiest of all edible mushrooms, but like A. bitorquis and A. bernardii, it requires thorough cooking to render it tender. "
