Species: deliciosus
Common_Name: Delicious Milk Cap
Group?: No
CAP 5-16 cm broad, broadly convex or with a depressed center and an inrolled margin when young, becoming depressed or shallowly funnel-shaped; surface viscid when moist but soon dry, smooth, often zoned; color variable: dull orange to carrot-orange or orange-brown, sometimes blotched with or entirely green; fading in age or dry weather to brownish, gray, dull greenish-gray, or even yellowish; margin inrolled when young. Flesh thick, brittle, orange to yellowish or greenish; taste mild or slightly bitter. LATEX very scanty, bright carrot-orange (but in some forms slowly staining dark red when exposed), eventually staining wounded or aged tissue greenish (within 5 hours). GILLS typically bright to dull orange, but varying to yellowish or orange-buff, greenish where wounded; adnate to decurrent, close. STALK 2-7 cm long, 1-2.5 cm thick, equal or narrowed at base, soon dry, sometimes scrobiculate; rigid, hollow inage, frequently maggot-riddled, colored like cap or paler. SPORE_PRINT creamy yellowish-buff; spores 7-11 x 6-8 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, with amyloid ridges. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious or in troops under conifers (pine, spruce, etc.), common and widely distributed. It is abundant in our coastal pine forests in the late fall and winter, generally after the major crop of look-alike L. rubrilacteus. EDIBILITY Edible, but not necessarily delicious. Several varieties or forms occur and some are apparently better than others. Special treatment is required to overcome the grainy texture and latent bitterness. Its abundance and distinctiveness, however, make experimentation worthwhile. Some sources recommend slow cooking (e.g., baked in a casserole), others insist it should be cooked rapidly in a frying pan with very little butter. It is popular in Europe, and the Russians are fanatical about it-especially salted. "

Common_Name: Bleeding Milk Cap
Group?: No
CAP 4-14 cm broad, broadly convex with a depressed center and inrolled margin when young, depressed or shallowly funnel-shaped in age; surface viscid when moist, smooth, reddish-brown to orange, orange-brown, or tan, or often concentrically zoned with these colors; duller and greenish-stained in age. Flesh thick, brittle, brownish to buff, reddish, etc.; taste mild or slightly bitter. LATEX scanty, dark red (but occasionally orange-red in old specimens), slowly staining wounded areas greenish. GILLS adnate to slightly decurrent, close, reddish or dull purplish-red, or tan with a dark reddish sheen; greenish where wounded. STALK 2-6 cm long, 1-2.5 cm thick, equal or narrowed below, firm, rigid, hollow, colored like cap or paler, sometimes scrobiculate. SPORE_PRINT pale yellowish or buff; spores 7.5-10 x 6-8 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, with amyloid ridges. HABITAT Scattered or in large troops under conifers throughout the West; associated in our area with Douglas-fir and abundant in the fall and early winter. Where pines pre-dominate it is largely supplanted by L. deliciosus, and where pine and Douglas-fir grow together, the two milk caps often mingle. In Europe, L. sanguifluus (which may be the same as L. rubrilacteus) is mycorrhizal with pine. EDIBILITY Edible, but not pleasing to everyone because of its granular texture; usually better, however, than L. deliciosus (see comments on edibility of that species). "

STALK 4-10 cm long, 1-3 cm thick, hard, rigid, smooth, equal; whitish when fresh but staining like the flesh (reddish or orangish, then smoky-brown to black). SPORE_PRINT white; spores 7-10 x 6-8 microns, broadly elliptical with amyloid warts and ridges. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups in woods; widely distributed. It is fairly common locally, along with R. dissimulans (see comments), but is not nearly as numerous as R. albonigra, R. brevi pes, or R. subnigricans. The majorcrop is in the fall or early winter. EDIBILITY Better dribbled than nibbled. The sharp taste is said to disappear in cooking, but the end product is insipid at best and indigestible or even poisonous at worst. "

Group?: Yes
CAP (5) 9-20 (30) cm broad, broadly convex to plane or depressed; surface slightly viscid when moist, smooth, whitish when young, soon becoming pale smoky-brown or dingy reddish-brown or dull ochraceous-stained, or often a sordid mixture of these shades; margin at first inrolled, not striate. Flesh thick, crisp, white, typically bruising slowly reddish (in 5-20 minutes), then usually browner or grayer within an hour, but sometimes staining grayish-brown directly (especially in stalk), or not at all; odor strong and unpleasant, at least in age or upon drying; taste mild to slightly bitter. GILLS thick, brittle, adnate to slightly decurrent, usually alternating long and short; pallid, soon stained dark or sordid reddish; close to fairly well-spaced. STALK(3) 7-13 cm long, (1.5) 3-7 cm thick, very hard, rigid, solid; equal orwith tapered base, smooth, white, staining sordid reddish andf or smoky-brown in age or when handled. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 6-10 microns, nearly round with low amyloid warts and ridges. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups under live oak; common in our area from late summer through early winter and also reported from Mississippi. In our area it is a good chanterelle-indicator (see comments). EDIBILITY Better trampled than sampled. The rank odor is hardly enticing and the Japanese version is extremely poisonous according to mycologist Tsuguo Hongo.* "

"Genus: Russula
Species: fragrantissima
Common_Name: Fragrant Russula; Fetid Russula
Group?: Yes
CAP 5-15 (20) cm broad, nearly round becoming convex, then plane or somewhat depressed; surface viscid or slimy when moist, smooth, yellowish to yellow-brown to bright ochre, straw-colored, orange-brown, or brown, often darker (or reddish-spotted) at the center; margin usually radially furrowed with small bumps (tuberculate-striate), at least in old age. Flesh thick, white or tinted cap color; odor heavy and penetrating-at first sweet (like maraschino cherries, almond extract, or benzaldehyde), but in age with a nauseating (fetid) component; taste nauseating; taste of gills acrid. GILLS creamy-white becoming yellowish or pale ochre, brownish-spotted in age, often beaded with water droplets when fresh; adnate to adnexed or free, fairly close. STALK 3-20 cm long, 1-4 cm thick, equal or somewhat tapered below, whitish to buff becoming yellowish or brownish-stained in age, especially near base; smooth or longitudinally lined, dry. SPORE_PRINT pale orange-yellow; spores 6-9 x 6-8 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round with amyloid warts and at least partially reticulate. HABITAT Solitary or scattered to gregarious on ground under both hardwoods and conifers, widely distributed. In our area it fruits mainly in the fall under oak, tanoak, and madrone; it can be found every year but is not nearly as numerous as the R. sororia group. EDIBILITY Unequivocally inedible and possibly poisonous-in other words, it is better punched than munched. The disgusting taste and strong odor should discourage most people from sampling it. "

SPORE_PRINT creamy to pale yellow; spores 6-9 x 5-7 microns, broadly elliptical with amyloid warts. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious in woods or at their edges, on lawns under trees, etc; common and widely distributed. In. our area it is often abundant in the fall and winter, especially under pine, oak, and Douglas-fir. EDIBILITY Better stomped than chomped-it might be poisonous and doesn't taste good anyway. "

CAP 5-18 cm or more broad, convex becoming plane or depressed; surface viscid when moist but soon dry, smooth, color variable, sometimes entirely but more often a mixture of: pinkish-lilac, dull purple, green, olive, yellow, blue-green, white, andlor brown; margin sometimes obscurely striate. Flesh thick, firm, white, crisp; odor mild or pleasant, taste mild. GILLS adnexed to adnate or slightly decurrent, many of them forked at least once; white or with a few brownish stains, slightly greasy to the touch. STALK 5-13 cm long, 1.5-5 cm thick, solid or stuffed, rather hard; more or less equal, smooth, white, but the flesh in base sometimes grayish. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 7-10 x 6-8 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round with isolated amyloid warts. Stalk not staining salmon in ferrous sulfate. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups or troops under hardwoods or sometimes conifers; widely distributed. It is often abundant shortly after the first fall rains in our live oak-tanoak-madrone forests, but fruits on into the winter. Like many Russulas, it is often concealed by fallen leaves. EDIBILITY Edible and choice; it is delectably sweet when young and rated highly in Europe. The hard, crisp buttons are hard to beat in omelets or with scalloped potatoes, but alas, they are also considered ""edible and choice"" by maggots! "

SPORE_PRINT white or creamy-white; spores 7-10 microns, nearly round with amyloid ridges. HABITAT Solitary or in small groups in woods or at their edges, widely distributed. It is fairly common in our area from late summer through the spring, usually with oak but never in large numbers (like lips and scissors. it tends to occur in pairs). It is partial to poor soil along trails or roadcuts. EDIBILITY Better whacked than sacked-the acrid taste is a deterrent. "

"Genus: Russula
Species: emetica
Common_Name: Emetic Russula; The Sickener
Group?: Yes
CAP 3-10 cm broad, rounded-convex becoming plane or broadly depressed; surface viscid when moist, smooth, bright red to scarlet, the center often darker; fading in age or wet weather to pink, orange, or blotched with white; margin eventually striate (but sometimes obscurely). Flesh white (but pink under the cuticle), brittle, odor mild, taste very acrid. GILLS white orcreamy-white, brittle, close, adnate to adnexed or free. STALK3-1 0 cm long, 0.7-2.5 cm thick, equal or thicker below, dry, white or whitish, usually with longitudinal lines. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 7-11 x 6.5-9 microns, elliptical with amyloid warts and ridges. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups or troops in woods, widely distributed and common. Our member of the R. emetica group fruits late in the season(winter) in chaparral and mixed woods (oak, madrone, manzanita, and pine), often intermingled with R. cremoricolor and Lactarius vinaceorufescens. It also grows on very rotten wood-unorthodox behavior for a Russula. EDIBILITY Pleasing to the eyes of all, to the tongues of some, but to the stomachs of none. As its name implies, it is poisonous, at least raw, and can be used to induce vomiting. Parboiling may destroy the toxins, but it hardly seems worth the trouble or risk. It is collected by Himalayan villagers, presumably for use in curries (consult your local travel agent for details). "
