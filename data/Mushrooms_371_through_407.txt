Two possibly distinct forms occur in our area: the typical one (shown in photo at bottom of p. 477) fruits mainly with planted birch trees in the fall, while a larger form occurs with oak and pine in the late fall and winter. EDIBILITY Dangerous! It is often eaten in Europe and by transplanted Europeans in America, but it can cause hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) and kidney failure if eaten raw, and sometimes even when thoroughly cooked! (A pparently the human body can develop a devastating sensitivity to it.) It often has a sour taste anyway, soitis best avoided and should never be eaten raw. The one recorded instance of a bonafide mycologist dying of mushroom-poisoning was attributed to this fungus! "
"Genus: Paxillus
Species: atrotomentosus
Common_Name: Velvet Pax
Group?: No
CAP 4-15 (20) cm broad, convex becoming plane or centrally depressed; surface dry, unpolished, velvety or with matted hairs, yellow-brown to rusty-brown to dingy reddish-brown becoming dull brown, dark brown, or blackish-brown in age; margin at first in-rolled. Flesh thick, rather firm or tough, pallid to ochre or buff. GILLS close or crowded, usually decurrent, tan to dull ochre, dingy yellowish, or paler; often forked or veined near stalk. STALK 2-9 (12) cm long. 1-3 (5) cm thick. often short and usually off-center or even lateral; solid, tough, densely velvety from a coating of brown to dark brown or blackish-brown, often matted hairs; apex often paler or yellowish. SPORE_PRINT yellowish to brownish; spores 5-6.5 x 3-4.5 microns, elliptical, smooth, many of them dextrinoid. HABITAT Solitary or in groups or tufts on oraround conifers (usually dead) or madrone; northern in distribution. It is fairly common in the Pacific Northwest in the late summer and fall, but rare in our area. It causes a carbonizing decay (brown rot) in its host. EDIBILITY Not recommended. Some people apparently collect it for the table, but the same can be said of P. involUlus, which has caused several deaths! (See comments on edibility ofthat species.) "
"Genus: Hygrophoropsis
Species: aurantiaca
Common_Name: False Chanterelle
Group?: No
CAP 2-8 (14) cm broad, convex becoming plane or somewhat depressed, the margin at first inrolled; surface dry, often somewhat felty or velvety, typically some shade of dark orange, brownish-orange, brownish-yellow, yellowish-brown, olive-brown, or dark brown (often darker or browner at center and orange to yellowish-orange at margin), but in one form whitish and in another blackish. Flesh thin, pallid or tinged orange or cap color; odor mild. GILLS decurrent, close, fairly thin and narrowat maturity (may be blunt when young); usually forked dichotomously; typically deep orange to bright orange, but sometimes pale orange or in one form yellowish. STALK 2-10 cm long, (0.2) 0.5-1 (2) cm thick, central or off-center, equal or enlarged toward base, often curved; dry, yellowish to orange or brownish-orange or colored more or less like cap. SPORE_PRINT white to creamy; spores 5-8 x 2.5-4.5 microns, elliptical, smooth, often dextrinoid. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups or tufts in humus and on rotting wood, usually under conifers; widely distributed. In our area it fruits from the fall through early spring, but seems most abundant in cool, dry weather when there are few other fleshy fungi out and about. I usually find it under pine or redwood. EDIBILITY To be avoided. In my experience it is edible-but far from incredible. Some sources, however, list it as mildly poisonous (whether or not this is a result of confusion with Omphalolus. as has been suggested, is unclear). "

SPORE_PRINT brown to yellowish-or olive-tinged; spores 9-15 x 3-6 microns, narrowly elliptical to spindle-shaped, smooth. HABITAT Solitary to widely scattered or in small groups (usually twos or threes) on ground in woods, widely distributed. The brown-capped form can be found nearly every year in our area, but seldom in quantity. Like the related Boletus subtomentosus, it fruits throughout the mushroom seaso, often along roads and trails. EDIBILITY Edible, but rarely found in sufficient numbers to be more than just a curious-ity. Some ""bolete-your-meat'ers"" rate it highly, but I've found it to be slimy and insipid. "
"Genus: Gomphidius
Species: oregonensis
Common_Name: Insidious Gomphidius
Group?: No
CAP 2-15 (18) cm broad, at first peglike, then broadly convex to plane or depressed; surface viscid or slimy when moist, smooth, color variable: whitish to salmon-buff to ochraceous-salmon to dull pinkish when young, becoming dingier(brownish to purplish-or vinaceous-gray to dark reddish-brown) in age, often spotted or stained smoky-gray to black. Flesh rather soft, white or grayish (or tinged cap color under cuticle), but brilliant yellow in lower part of stalk or at base. GILLS decurrent, soft and rather waxy, close to fairly well-spaced, white or pallid, then gray and finally blackish as spores ripen. STALK 5-15 cm long, 1-5 cm thick, equal or tapered below(or occasionally swollen), solid, rather firm or even tough, dry and white above the veil, whitish or dingy below and viscid when wet, sometimes with darker streaks; lower portion bright yellow. VEIL whitish and fibrillose beneath a layer of slime; disappearing or forming a slight hairy-slimy superior ring on stalk which is subsequently blackened by falling spores. SPORE_PRINT smoky-gray to black; spores 10-14 (16) x 4.5-8 microns, spindle-shaped to narrowly elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious on ground under Douglas-fir and other conifers, often in small clumps which originate deep in the soil and may include one or more aborted fruiting bodies; known only from western North America and very common, (along with G. glutinosus-see comments) on the Pacific Coast. In our area it grows with Douglas-fir, often mingling with Suillus species (S. caerulescens, S. lakei, S. ponderosus), from the fall through early spring. EDIBILITY Edible, but its sliminess makes it undesirable-except as a possible escargot substitute. To clean the cap, simply peel off the slimy pellicle (skin). "

CAP (1) 2-10 (13) cm broad, peglike to nearly conical or convex when young, becoming somewhat top-shaped to plane or even shallowly depressed (but often with a slight umbo); surface smooth to finely fibrillose (or sometimes scaly in age), viscid when wet, often lustrous or silky when dry; color variable: dull orange to ochraceous to grayish, brownish, yellow-brown, olive-brown, bister, or reddish-brown, often wine-red to dark vinaceous-brown in age and tending to developing wine-red stains where rotten or when dried; margin at first incurved. Flesh thick, usually pale orange but varying to buff, salmon, or ochraceous-buff(often somewhat yellower in lower portion of stalk); often becoming wine-red in old age or where injured. GILLS broad, fairly well-spaced, decurrent or occasionally adnate, pale to dull orange or ochraceous when young, then clouded gray with spores and finally blackish in old age. STALK typically long, slender, and sometimes sinuous, but at other times short and rather thick; 2.5-15 (20) cm long, 0.5-2 (6) cm thick; equal or more often tapered downward; dry, solid, firm; pale orange to yellow-orange to orange-buff, ochraceous, or reddish-tinted when young, often more vinaceous-red in age andlor with reddish fibrils. VEIL dry, fibrillose, ochraceous to orange, soon disappearing or leaving a slight hairy ring on stalk. SPORE_PRINT smoky-gray to smoky-black, sometimes with an olive tinge; spores (14) 17-23 x 4.5-7.5 microns, more or less spindle-shaped, smooth. Cystidia on gills large, thick-walled. HABITAT Solitary to scattered or gregarious on ground under conifers, particularly pine; widely distri buted, but especially common in northern and western North America. Along with C. rutilus (see comments), it is a prominent fungal facet of our pine forests and is also frequent in yards and lawns where pines have been planted. The major crop is usually in the late fall or winter and is often accompanied by masses of mushy slippery jacks (Suillus species), but it can be found most any time. It is quite sporadic in its fruiting habits-overwhelmingly abundant some years, very sparse during others. EDIBILITY Edible, but like all pine spikes, better dried than fresh (see comments on p. 484). It is usually very clean, and unlike Suillus, is shunned by maggots. "
