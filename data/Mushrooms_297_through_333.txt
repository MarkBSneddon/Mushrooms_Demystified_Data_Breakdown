Group?: No
CAP 0.5-2.5 cm broad and high, narrowly conical to bell-shaped with a pointed umbo, scarcely expanding in age; surface smooth, chesnut-brown to brown or olive-brown and at least slightly viscid when moist, fading to tan, olive-buff, or even yellowish as it dries; margin sometimes with bluish or olive stains. Flesh very thin, pallid. GILLS adnate to adnexed or seceding, pallid, soon becoming gray, then finally dark purple-brown or chocolate-brown; edges whitish. STALK 3-10 cm long, 1-2 (3) mm thick, equal, often curved or sinuous, pliant, whitish or with brownish base, sometimes with a bluish or blue-green tinge in age, especially at base. VEIL absent or rudimentary. SPORE_PRINT purple-brown; spores 11-14 x 7-9 microns, elliptical, smooth. Chrysocystidia absent on gills. HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious in pastures, tall grass, etc., but not on dung; widely distributed. It is especially common west of the Cascades from northern California to British Columbia. It fruits from late summer through early winter or sometimes in the spring. I have not found it in our area. EDIBILITY Hallucinogenic (see p. 895), and often gathered for recreational use despite its small size. It is not as potent as P. cyanescens, but is much stronger than P. pelliculosa. "

Color Plate 88 CAP 1.5-4 (5) cm broad, soon convex to broadly convex, then plane or with an uplifted, often wavy margin; surface smooth, viscid when moist, dark brown or reddish-brown becoming caramel-brown, then fading as it dries to tan, yellowish-brown, or paler; sometimes with blue or blue-green stains, especially near margin. Flesh thin, bruising blue or blue-green. GILLS typically adnate but sometimes seceding, fairly close, brown or cinnamon-brown becoming dark smoky-brown or sometimes bluish-stained; edges whitish. STALK 3-8 cm long, 2-6 (8) mm thick, equal or with an enlarged base, sometimes curved; dry, whitish, but staining blue to bluish-green when handled or bruised. VEIL fibrillose or cobwebby, copious but disappearing or at most forming a very slight ring or hairy zone on stalk. SPORE_PRINT purple-brown to purple-gray or purple-black; spores 9-12 x 5-9 microns, elliptical, smooth. Chrysocystidia absent on gills. HABITAT Widely scattered to densely gregarious on wood chips, sawdust, mulch, and humus, and on lawns rich in lignin; partial to coniferous debris, but also fond of alder and eucalyptus. It is fairly common in the San Francisco Bay area in cold weather (December-February), especially in landscaped areas and mulched flower beds, and is also fairly common in oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. It is easily cultivated, and its aggressive mycelium responds readily to transplanting-given the proper conditions. EDIBILITY Hallucinogenic (see p. 895) and extremely potent, especially ra w. Along with P. baeocystis and P. stricti pes (see comments), it is the most powerful known hallucino-genic mushroom in the north temperate zone. only one or two caps are needed to induce marked changes in perception and sensation. Psilocin is primarily responsible, with psilocybin and possibly other compounds contributing to the effects. Together they are said toconstituteO.6olo ofthe mushroom on a dry weight basis-substantially more than the better known P. cubensis.

"Genus: Psilocybe
Species: stuntzii
Common_Name: Stuntz's Blue Legs
Group?: No
CAP 1-4 (5) cm broad, bluntly conical becoming convex to broadly umbonate, plane, or with an uplifted margin in age; surface smooth, viscid when moist, color variable: deep olive-brown to chestnut-brown when young, but often fading as it ages or dries to dingy yellow-brown or yellowish-buff; margin striate when moist and often tinged greenish. Flesh thin, pallid to brownish. GILLS adnate or adnexed, pallid soon becoming grayish or brownish; close or fairly well-spaced. STALK 2-6 cm long, 1.5-4 mm thick, equal or thicker at either end, often curved, yellowish to brown or sometimes with darker or bluish stains, especially below; not viscid, often with mycelial threads at base. VEIL membranous but thin; forming a fragile ring or fibrillose zone on stalk which is often blue or bluish-green but eventually may be darkened by falling spores or may disappear. SPORE_PRINT dark purple-brown; spores 8-12 x 6-8 microns, elliptical, smooth. Chrysocystidia absent on gills. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious or clustered on wood chips, mulch, etc., in lawns, gardens, and landscaped areas; also under conifers and in fields. It is known only from the west coast and is especially common in the Puget Sound region of Washington in the fall, early winter, and spring. (The appearance of large numbers in wood chip mulch on the University of Washington campus in Seattle more than a decade ago helped spur the ""magic mushroom"" craze that subsequently swept the Pacific Northwest.) In our area I have found it in mulched flower pots. EDIBILITY Weakly hallucinogenic (see p. 895), but popular with ""magic mushroom"" hunters because it often fruits in large numbers. Be sure not to confuse it with deadly Galerina species, which can look quite similar, but have rusty-brown spores-they will even grow intermixed with P. stuntzii! "

Common_Name: Magic Mushroom
Group?: No
CAP 1.5-8 (10) cm broad, broadly conical or oval or bell-shaped (often with an umbo) when young, gradually expanding to convex, broadly umbonate, or plane; surface smooth or with small whitish veil remnants when young, viscid when moist, soon dry, color variable: whitish with a brown to yellowish center, or entirely yellow to yellowish-buff to yellow-brown, or sometimes cinnamon-brown when young and sometimes dingy olive in old age; bruising and aging bluish; margin sometimes hung with veil remnants. Flesh firm, white, staining blue or blue-green when bruised. GILLS close, adnate to adnexed or seceding to free; pallid, soon becoming gray, then deep purple-gray to nearly black; edges whitish. STALK 4-15 cm long, 0.4-1.5 cm thick, equal or more often thicker below, dry, white or sometimes yellowish to yellow-brown, aging or bruising blue or blue-green; smooth. VEIL membranous, white or bluish-stained, usually forming a thin, fragile, superior ring on stalk which is blackened by falling spores. SPORE_PRINT dark purple-brown to blackish; spores 11-17 x 7-12 microns, elliptical, smooth, thick-walled, with a large apical germ pore. Cystidia present on faces of gills, but chrysocystidia absent. HABITAT Solitary or in groups on dung and manure, especially in cattle pastures; widely distributed in the tropics and subtropics-Colombia, Central America, Mexico, etc.-and in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Since it is being cultivated on a widespread basis, it may eventually turn up in the warmer parts of California-as it did in Santa Cruz during muggy summer weather (on compost from a ""magic mushroom"" farm). It can be cultivated on a variety of simple grain or compost mediums, but strict temperature control and sterile conditions are necessary to induce growth and prevent contamination. EDIBILITY Hallucinogenic (see p. 895). It is not as powerful on a dry weight basis as P. cyanescens, but is larger. At one time the demand for ""magic mushrooms"" far out-stripped the supply, with the result that many of the ""psilocybin"" mushrooms sold on the street were actually grocery store mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus ) laced with LS D or other substances (one sample I examined proved to be a soggy chanterelle soaked in ammonia!). Now that cultivation procedures have been refined, you're much more likely to get the real thing. It is often sold dried, though drying decreases the potency. The mycelium is also ""active."" Ironically, natives of Oaxaca, Mexico, consider this species inferior to others, such as P. mexicana (perhaps because it was unknown to them until the Spaniards intro-duced cattle). Instead of using it themselves, they sell it to eager gringos! "

HABITAT Solitary or in small groups on dung, manure, rich soil, straw, and grazed or fertilized grass; widely distributed, and one of our most common dung fungi. In our area it fruits whenever it is damp, often in the company of Psilocybe coprophila and the Pan-aeolus campanulatus group. EDIBILITY Edible, but slimy and mediocre according to most sources.
