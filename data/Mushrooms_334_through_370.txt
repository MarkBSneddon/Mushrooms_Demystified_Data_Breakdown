CAP 2-12 cm broad, convex or obtuse becoming nearly plane; surface dry, at first covered with dense, dark red to purple-red or reddish-brown, fibrillose scales, these fading slowly to pinkish-red or yellowish-red; surface finally yellowish in old age as scales disperse; margin inrolled at first. Flesh thick, reddish to lavender, then fading to yellowish; taste bitter. GILLS notched to adnate or slightly decurrent, fairly close, yellow becoming bright rusty-orange or rust-colored as spores mature. STALK 3-10 cm long, 0.3-2 cm thick, fleshy, equal or enlarged below (or tapered downward if clustered); solid, dry, fibrillose, more or less colored like cap, becoming yellowish or rusty-stained. VEIL fibrillose to somewhat membranous, yellowish; forming a hairy, superior ring on stalk which may disappear or trap falling spores. SPORE_PRINT bright rusty-orange; spores 5.5-8.5 x 3.5-4.5 microns, elliptical, roughened. HABITAT In groups or clusters on decaying coniferous wood, sawdust, and humus rich in lignin (rarely on hardwoods); widespread, but not common. I have seen one fantastic local fruiting, under pine at New Brighton Beach State Park, with Pluteus cervinus and large clusters of Pholiota terrestris and Naematoloma fasciculare (all certified wood-lovers) also present. EDIBILITY Unknown, but the closely related G. aeruginosus is said to be hallucinogenic. "

CAP 5-40 cm or more broad, convex becoming broadly convex or nearly plane; surface dry, smooth to silky or fibrillose, often breaking up to form small scales; bright yellow-orange to yellowish-buff when young (or at times nearly whitish from overlaid fibrils), often somewhat darker in age (rusty-orange to golden-tawny to orange-brown or reddish-brown); margin at first incurved, sometimes wavy, sometimes with veil remnants. Flesh thick, firm, yellowish; taste bitter. GILLS notched to adnate or slightly decurrent, close, ochre-buff or pale yellow becoming more or less rusty-orange to rusty-brown in age. STALK (3) 5-25 cm long, 1-6 (10) cm thick, usually swollen in the middle or below, the base often narrowed; solid, firm, dry, rusty-orange to rusty-yellow or paler, fibrillose below the ring. VEIL pallid to pale yellowish or rusty-stained, membranous or fibrillose, sometimes disappearing, but usually forming a superior ring on stalk; ring soon stained with rusty-orange spores, often collapsing or disappearing in age. SPORE_PRINT bright rusty-orange; spores 7-10.5 x 4.5-6 microns, elliptical, roughened or wrinkled. HABITAT Usually in clusters (occasionally solitary) on or around stumps and trees; widely distributed. This species ""complex"" favors conifers on the west coast, hardwoods in eastern North America. In our area it is quite common on old pine stumps in the fall, winter, and early spring, and occasionally turns up on eucalyptus also. EDIBILITY Inedible due to the bitter taste. Forms in Asia and eastern North America apparently contain psilocybin andlor psilocin and are hallucinogenic (hence the Japanese name, ""Big Laughing Mushroom""). on the west coast, however, it is apparently ""in-active."" An Ohio woman had an unforgettable experience after inadvertently nibbling on one. She found herself in an alien world offantastic shapes and glorious colors, and while concerned friends were rushing her to the hospital, she was heard to mutter, ""If this is the way you die from mushroom poisoning, then I'm all for it. . .""

I have seen large fruitings in Washington and Idaho in the late summer and fall. It also occurs in northern California and the Sierra Nevada, but I have yet to find it in our area.

CAP 5-15 cm broad, convex with an inrolled margin when young, becoming broadly con-vex or plane surface smooth, viscid or slimy when moist, at first yellow but darkening slowly to cinnamon-brown, orange-brown, or reddish-brown from the center outward, the margin often remaining yellowish. Flesh thick, firm, pallid to pale yellow with distinct lavender or violet areas near cap cuticle and in stalk; often ochraceous-yellow in base of stalk; odor mild. GILLS close, adnate to adnexed, yellow or sometimes greenish-yellow when young, dull cinnamon-brown in age, but often with an intermediate lavender to dull purple phase. STALK 4-12 cm long, 1.5-3 cm thick at apex, with a conspicuous, abrupt basal bulb which is rimmed, at least when young and is 3-7 cm broad; solid, not viscid, color variable: pale lavender or yellow at apex or throughout, becoming dingy or often rusty-stained in age, the bulb usually yellow. CORTINA pale yellow to greenish-yellow, usually leaving hairs on the stalk which trap falling spores. SPORE_PRINT rusty-brown; spores 11-14 x 6.5-8 microns, elliptical, roughened. HABITAT Solitary to scattered or gregarious on ground in woods, mainly in western North America. It is sometimes common in our area under oak in the late fall and winter; in the Pacific Northwest it favors conifers and in the Southwest I've seen it in mixed woods of aspen, spruce, and fir.

CAP 3-10 cm broad, convex to broadly convex with the margin inrolled somewhat at first, expanding in age; surface smooth, viscid when moist, color variable: usually olive-green to dark olive-brown, but in some varieties brownish at the center and greenish to greenish-yellow at the margin, and in others bright grass-or citrine-green, often with a browner center or brownish spots and fibrils. Flesh pallid to yellowish, thick, firm; odor and taste usually mild. GILLS close, notched or adnexed to adnate, typically olive to greenish-yellow (in some forms with a fleeting initial lavender or bluish-violet stage), but in some forms yellow when young, all forms becoming browner or rustier as spores mature. STALK 4-10 cm long, 0.5-1.5 (2) cm thick at apex, equal above, the base with a more or less rimmed, abrupt bulb when young that may become oblique or obscure in age; usually greenish like the cap or yellower or even pallid (in age), the apex sometimes bluish, the bulb often sulfur-yellow; solid, not viscid. CORTINA olive to yellow, usually leaving hairs on stalk which turn rusty-brown from falling spores. SPORE_PRINT rusty-brown; spores 9-13 x 6-7.5 microns, elliptical, roughened. HABITAT Solitary to scattered or gregarious on ground in woods; widely distributed. Some members of this group (see comments) favor conifers and are fairly common in the Pacific Northwest; others grow under oak and other hardwoods, including one uniden-tified variety that is common in our area in the fall and winter with live oak (see comments). EDIBILITY Due to difficulty in identification, this entire group should be avoided. The group as a whole is probably edible, but I wouldn't bet my life on it-and that's just what you do when testing a Cortinarius! "

Group?: No
CAP 1-5 cm broad, conical or bell-shaped at first, expanding somewhat in age but usually retaining an umbo; surface smooth, not viscid but somewhat hygrophanous, tawny to ochre to orange-brown or rusty-yellow, fading in age or as it dries. Flesh thin, yellowish. GILLS fairly well-spaced, adnexed to adnate, ochre-yellow to cinnamon-brown becoming browner in age. STALK 3-10 cm long, 3-5 (7) mm thick, more or less equal, colored like the cap or more cinnamon-colored; often (but not always) with traces of the yellow veil when young; not viscid. UNIVERSAL_VEIL yellow, disappearing or leavinga few patches or hairs on stalk. CORTINA also yellow, disappearing or leaving hairs on stalk. SPORE_PRINT rusty-brown; spores 7-9x 5.5-7 microns, elliptical, minutely roughened. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious or in troops in moss or duffunderconifers; widelydis-tributed. It is sometimes abundant in the summer and fall in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest, but is not likely to be collected by the average mushroom hunter. EDIBILITY DEADLY POISONOUS! Fortunately, it is seldom eaten because of its small size. Along with several other Cortinarii in the subgenus Leprocybe (notably C. orellanus and C. speciosissimus), it contains toxins which destroy the liver. Symptoms are greatly delayed (it may be two weeks before they appear!), making the culprit difficult to pinpoint. "
