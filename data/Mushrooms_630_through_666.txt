"Genus: Phallus
Species: impudicus
Common_Name: Stinkhorn
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY beginning as an ""egg"" up to 6 cm high. PERIDIUM (skin) white to yellowish-white in one variety, lurid pinkish to purple in another (see comments), with a gelatinous layer beneath; rupturing to form a volva as the stalk elongates and thrusts the slimy, swollen ""head"" upward. CAP (""head"") 1.5-4 cm broad, coated with the putrid, copious spore slime which eventually drips off or is carried or washed away, revealing the whitish reticulate (pitted and ridged) surface beneath; top with a hole which is sometimes covered by a clinging piece of the peridium (volva) andlor by numerous flies. STALK 1.5-3 cm thick, equal or tapered at both ends, entirely white or sometimes pinkish below; minutely honeycombed (spongelike), hollow, fragile. INDUSIUM (""veil"") absent or rudimentary. VOLVA present at base of stalk as a white to pinkish or purple, loose, lobed sack formed by the ruptured peridium; base usually with a thick, similarly-colored mycelial cord(s). SPORE_MASS slimy or mucilaginous, olive-green to olive-brown, with an obnoxious odor at maturity (see p. 765). Spores 3-5 x 1.5-2.5 microns, elliptical or oblong, smooth. HABITAT Solitary or in groups or clusters in lawns, gardens, sandy or cultivated soil, under trees or shrubs, in rich humus, etc.; widely distributed and especially common in the West, fruiting whenever conditions are favorable. McIlvaine states that, ""its favorite abode is in kitchen yards and under wooden steps where, when mature, it will compel the household to seek it out in self-defense,"" and his contemporary Nina Marshall says, ""the distracted housewife searches in vain for a solution to the difficulty and the odor disappears as mysteriously as it came. If she is one of the initiated, however, she will search until she finds the haunt of the offender andthen destroy it on the spot to avoid further repitition of the nuisance."" The largest fruitings I have seen were on the lawn of a school in Los Angeles, and in front of an old cathedrl in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Stinkhorn specialist William Burk recalls seeing massive clusters that apparently sprung from the foundation of a house in Salt Lake City, Utah. If the ""eggs"" are carried home and transplanted in cool, damp earth, more often than not they will continue to develop so that the fasci-nating elongation process can be observed firsthand. EDIBILITY Not poisonous (see comments on p. 765), but as Alexander Smith says, ""who would want to eat even the eggs?"" Captain Charles McIlvaine (the plenipotentiary extraordinaire of turn-of-the-century toadstool testers), for one. He says, ""(the eggs) are semigelatinous, tenacious, and elastic, like bubbles of some thick substance. In this condition, they demand to be eaten. . . cut in slices and fried or stewed, they make a most tender, agreeable food."" "

PERIDIUM (skin) white or sometimes tinged buff, gray, or reddish-brown, with an inner gelatinous layer; rupturing to form a volva as the stalk elongates. Mature fruiting body 7-25 cm tall, unbranched, consisting of a more or less conical to bell-shaped cap on a stalk, with a large lacelike veil or ""skirt"" flaring out from beneath the cap. CAP (""head"") 1.5-4 cm broad, coated at first with the putrid olive-green to brown spore slime, which eventually drips off or is carried away by insects, revealing a white or yellowish, ridged and pitted (reticulate) surface beneath; top with a hole in it.

INDU-SIUM (""veil"") white, initially tucked under the cap margin but soon unfurling; skirtlike or basketlike when fully expanded and touching or nearly touching the ground (6 cm or more high); attached to the top of the stalk or just under the margin of the cap; composed of white strands that form an intricate chainlike or lacelike net whose ""holes"" are large and polygonal. VOLVA present at base of stalk as a white or pallid, loose, often lobed sack formed by the ruptured peridium; base usually with a thick mycelial cord(s) attached. SPORE_MASS slimy or mucilaginous, olive-green to olive-brown or brown, with a fetid odor at maturity that attracts flies, beetles, and other insects (but odor not always strong, and in one form somewhat sweetish). Spores 3.5-4.5 x 1.5-2 microns, elliptical to oblong, smooth. HABITAT Solitary or in groups in humus or on rotten wood in tropical forests and at their edges; fruiting in wet weather, widely distributed.

Spores 3-7x 1.5-2.5 microns, elliptical or oblong, smooth. HABITAT Solitary to gregarious or clustered on ground and rotten wood in gardens, roadsides, woods, etc.; widely distributed and fairly common in eastern North America in the late summer and fall (along with M. elegans-see comments). It is apparently absent in the West, but a white variety (see comments) has been found in oregon, and it seems only a matter oftime before the typical form and its longer look-alike, M. elegans, show up on the west coast, as several other erotic exotics have. EDIBILITY Nonpoisonous. Mature specimens, of course, are hardly tempting, but Bill Roody of Elkins, West Virginia, says the ""eggs"" are excellent ""peeled and rolled in flour seasoned with garlic salt and pepper, dipped into beaten egg and then once again in the flour mix before frying in butter or oil.

Mature fruiting body 5-12 cm high, consisting of (4) 5-7 (8) arms or ""tentacles"" arising from a common stalk or ""tube,"" or sometimes with up to 12 arms arising from two fused stalks. ARMS long and slender, 3-9 (12) cm long, tapered toward their tips, at first upright and roughly parallel and joined at their tips (often in pairs), soon opening outward like the petals of a flower and eventually curling back and under so that the tips often touch the ground (but sometimes one or more arms branched, and at other times the tips remaining joined to others). Inner (or upper) surfaces of arms bright red to pinkish-red, usually paler toward base, ribbed or reticulate and coated with spore slime. Outer surfaces (undersides) pale pink, longitudinally grooved. STALK 1-3 (5) cm long, typically short and sometimes hidden by the volva (but a long-stalked form is also known); hollow and tubular (open at the top), detaching easily from the volva, white or pallid below, pinkish above.

HABITAT Solitary to gregarious or clustered on ground (especially sandy soil) or rotten wood in various habitats; widely distributed (Tasmania, Russia, etc.), but rare in North America. It is fairly common in the riparian woodlands along the San Lorenzo River in Santa Cruz County, California (especially in the spring, but fruiting most any time). I have also found it under a rose bush growing on a mixture of compost and rice hulls. EDIBILITY Nonpoisonous, and like most stinkhorns, edible in the egg stage. one spring evening a former friend and I decided to sample two ""eggs,"" following a recipe for French-fried stinkhorn eggs (see comments on edibility of Mutinus caninus). The flavor wasn't bad, but we neglected to strip away the gelatinous outer layer. It proved to be so slippery that the ""eggs"" slid down our throats before we could savor them, leaving behind only the sticky spore mucilage (see Color Plate 198), which clung to our throats and tongues so tenaciously that we were still trying to wash it away several hours later!

STALK 1.5 cm long, 0.5-2 (3.5) cm thick, equal or thicker below, the base often somewhat wrinkled, pitted, or irregular; white to creamy or buff, usually scurfy or minutely warted; typically hollow in cross-section. SPORES 18-25 x 10-15 microns, elliptical, smooth, without oil droplets. HABITAT Solitary to gregarious in gardens and other suburban habitats, under fruit trees, in old orchards, in woods and at their edges; etc.; widely distributed, fruiting mainly in the spring. In eastern North America its appearance marks the beginning of the end of the morel season. In coastal California it is not uncommon in the spring, especially in sandy soil, but occurs practically year-round. one couple I know gets a small crop under their plum tree every Christmas! Another ""white morel"" occurs in the Sierra Nevada and Cascades (see comments). EDIBILITY Delectably delicious, as the species epithet implies. Like all morels, it should be cooked (see comments on pp. 785-786 for more details). "

CAP 2-6 (10) cm or more broad and 2-10 (18) cm or more high; usually conical to oval or somewhat irregular in shape; margin joined to the stalk but often with a crease at its point of attachment; overall color usually quite dark, especially in age. Pits usually vertically elongated andlor arranged in vertical rows, but in some forms meandering (see com-ments); yellow-brown to brown, grayish, olive-brown, or even reddish-brown, sometimes becoming blackish in age. Ridges vertically aligned in some forms, colored like the pits at first, usually darker (olive-brown to smoky-brown to black) before or by maturity (and sometimes dark from the beginning). Interior hollow, the surface pallid or whitish or tinged cap color, roughened. Flesh fragile in some forms. STALK 1.5-10 (20) cm or more long, (0.5) 1-4 cm or more thick, slender in some forms, as thick as the cap in others (often proportionately longer and thicker in age); equal or enlarged at either end, often grooved andlor wrinkled, especially toward base; sometimes nearly smooth, more often entirely or partially scurfy from a coating of small granules or warts; white to creamy, buff, pinkish-tan, or sometimes with a reddish tinge; typically hollow in cross-section. SPORES (18) x 20-25 (30) x 11-15 microns, elliptical, smooth, without oil droplets. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups, clusters, or troops on ground in woods and at their edges (especially under conifers and aspen) and in burned areas, less commonly in urban and suburban settings; very widely distributed (Japan to the Himalayas, Europe, etc.), but especially common in northern and western North America. Like other morels, its season is the spring(or early summer at higher altitudes), but"" freak"" fruitingscan occur in the fall, particularly if a warm wet spell follows cold weather. In coastal California, where the seasons are not strongly defined. black morels occur year-round. but seldom in quantity. In colder regions they are often abundant, usually two to five weeks after the snow melts. Look for them in the Sierra Nevada when the snow plants (bright red sapro-phytic plants) have fully emerged, and in the Cascades when the calypso orchids are in bloom (see Color Plate 199). Don't expect to find them everywhere, however. For one thing, you face fierce competition from other collectors; for another, ttrey are devilishly difficult to see, because they look just like fallen pine or fir cones (see Color Plate 202). Also, they show a definite preference for semi-disturbed areas, e.g., campgrounds, along roads, and in logged and burned areas. Bushels can be harvested one to two years after a forest fire, providing the spring weather is favorable. EDIBILITY Edible and delectable (see comments on pp. 785-786). However, some people are apparently ""allergic"" to it. Like all morels, it should never be eaten raw. "

It typically appears one to three weeks before the true morels (Morchella species), sometimes in the same places. It is abundant in parts ofthe Pacific Northwest. In our area I have seen large fruitings under cottonwood and alder. EDIBILITY Edible with caution. Although eaten by many people, it can cause severe stomach cramps and loss of muscular coordination, particularly when consumed in large amounts or on several successive days. The flavor is strong but not on a par with the true morels. Always cook it, and beware: some of the ""morels"" sold in markets are Verpas! "

Fertile surface nearly smooth when very young but becoming more wrinkled as it matures, deep reddish-brown or purplish-brown to bay-brown, dark brown, or brown, or in some forms yellowish-brown; typically attached to the stalk at several points. Underside usually paler; interior hollow or chambered. Flesh rather thin and brittle.

SPORES 17-28 x (7) 9-13 (16) microns, elliptical, smooth, usually with two oil droplets. HABITAT Solitary, scattered. or in groups under both hardwoods and conifers; fruiting in the spring (or early summer in colder climates) and very widely distributed, but espe-cially common in northern and montane coniferous forests. It is not very common in our area (perhaps the winters aren't cold enough), but is often abundant in the Sierra Nevada, Cascades, and other mountain ranges of the West. It is often encountered while morel hunting. The fruiting bodies persist for several weeks before decaying. EDIBILITY Dangerously poisonous, at least raw! Although eaten without ill effect by many people, this species has caused numerous deaths in Europe (see p. 799 for more details). Far fewer cases of poisoning have been reported from North America, suggesting that the American version is safer than the European one, or that certain ecological variants are less toxic. However, the paucity of poisonings may also indicate that fewer Americans eat it, or that those who do treat it with more caution. I certainly don't think it's worth the risk. In the words of mycophagist Charles McIlvaine, who was famous for his willingness to eat almost anything: ""It is not probable that in our great food-giving country anyone will be narrowed to G. esculenta for a meal. Until such emergency arrives, the species would be better left alone."" "

HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious in woods and at their edges, along streams, or often in somewhat disturbed soil (e.g., along old skid roads); widespread in western North America, fruiting mainly in the late spring and summer, but sometimes in the fall or even winter. I have not found it in our area, but it occurs in the Sierra Nevada. As the species epithet implies, it was originally collected in California, but seems to be more common in the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains. Alexander Smith says he could have collected ""several bushel baskets"" of it on the Olympic Peninsula one year. EDIBILITY To be avoided.
