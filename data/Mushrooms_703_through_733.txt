"Genus: Pachyphloeus
Species: citrinus
Common_Name: Berry Truffle
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY underground, 0.5-3 cm broad, more or less round (spherical) to slightly lobed or tapered below, firm but not hard; apex often with a depression, circular furrow, or cluster of furrows; base often with a tuft of mycelium. Exterior usually divided into polygonal warts; color variable, but usually bright to dull orange to brown. IN-TERIOR more or less solid, composed of sterile veins which often converge toward the apex or depression and form elongated pockets of fertile tissue between them; entirely whitish when young, becoming grayish to grayish-olive with paler (white to yellowish) veins, and eventually becoming dark olive to blackish with yellow to pale olive veins. Odor of mature specimens sometimes pungent (""'like rotting weeds""-Herb Saylor) after col-lecting, at other times mild. SPORES (11) 13-21 microns, round, smooth and hyaline (colorless under the microscope) at first, becoming spiny, and at maturity the spines enlarging into broader, conical to truncate warts or ""pegs"" that look like miniature golf tees; usually yellowish at maturity. Asci typically 8-spored, forming an irregular palisade (hymenium) along the sterile veins andlor randomly imbedded in the surrounding tissue. HABITAT Solitary to gregarious in soil under both hardwoods and conifers; very widely distributed (throughout most of North America and Europe). In our area it fruits, like other truffles, in the winter, spring, and early summer. I have found it several times under tan oak and madrone in June and July, and it has turned up repeatedly under live oak in the Guadelupe Mines area near Almaden, California. EDIBILITY Specimens I sampled had little taste, but were immature. "
"Genus: Hydnobolites
Species: californicus
Common_Name: Gristly Truffle
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY underground, 0.5-4 cm broad, roundish to oval, usually lobed or folded but quite compact. gristly or fatty and rubbery in texture (especially the interior), not hard. Exterior often roughened but lacking warts, whitish to buff or dingy yellowish, often becoming ochre-tan or dingy brown in age or as it dries. INTERIOR more or less solid, with several narrow, meandering sterile veins or canals; white to slightly grayish, but often discoloring brown when cut and dried or in old age. Odor mild or sometimes musty at maturity. SPORES 14-18 (24) microns, round, very coarsely alveolate at maturity, the ridges of the alveoli (pits) projecting like needles from the edges of the spore; hyaline (colorless) to yellowish or pale brown under microscope. Asci mostly 8-spored, imbedded in the tissue between the veins, not arranged in a palisade (hymenium). HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups or pockets of several individuals in soil and humus under trees and in woods. As its name implies, it was originally discovered in Cali-fornia, but appears to be widely distributed in North America. In our area it is fairly com-mon from January to July under many trees, but especially oak. EDIBILITY Prized by slugs, despised by humans. The texture is fatty but the flavor is not. "
"Genus: Choiromyces
Species: alveolatus
Common_Name: Hard Truffle
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY usually underground, (0.5) 1-10 cm broad, nearly round or more often lobed or knobby (potato-like); very hard, without a mycelial tuft at the base. Exterior usually roughened or minutely downy, whitish when very young becoming yellowish to tawny, brown, or rusty-brown in age. INTERIOR more or less solid and very firm, consistency rather like hard wax; at first white or pallid, but becoming marbled with darker (yellowish to orange, yellow-brown, or rusty-brown) veins or chambers which are usually solid but occasionally empty. Odor mild or distinctive (see comments).

Asci mostly8-spored (but many appearing 1-4-spored in younger specimens), arranged in a palisade (hymenium) lining the veins or chambers (but see comments). HABITAT Solitary to gregarious in soil under trees and in the woods; known only from western North America, occasional (if you're looking for truffles) in the late winter, spring, and early summer. It is particularly numerous in the Sierra Nevada, but also occurs along the coast. Like the Tubers, it takes several weeks or months to mature. EDIBILITY : Tempting and probably edible, but I can find no mention of anyone eating it. "
"Genus: Tuber
Species: gibbosum
Common_Name: oregon White Truffle
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY usually underground, 1.5-5 (8) cm broad, nearly round to irregularly knobby or potato-like; firm or hard, without a basal mycelial tuft. Exterior minutely downy or irregularly roughened but not warted, whitish when young becoming pale buff to tan or brown, then usually developing darker (reddish to purple-brown) areas when fully mature; often cracking in age. INTERIOR solid, marbled, crisp; whitish when young, the fertile tissue becoming brown to dark brown to brick-red when mature, the meandering sterile veins remaining whitish. Odor usually strong and garlicky when fully mature. SPORES 35-52 x 17-40 microns, elliptical or elongated, reticulate-alveolate (ridged and pitted with shallow depressions) when mature but smooth when very young; dark yellow-brown to brown under the microscope when mature. Asci mostly 1-to 6-spored, randomly imbedded in the tissue between the veins. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious in woods and at their edges, associated mainly if not exclusively with Douglas-fir (usually trees between the ages of 8 and 65 years); found from California to British Columbia, but especially common in oregon. Although it normally grows underground, I have found specimens on the surface. (They were probably dug up by squirrels, then rejected for reasons known only to squirrels.) EDIBILITY Edible and choice, but widespread collecting can be destructive! It smells like the white truffle of Europe (T. magnatum), and some people proclaim it just as good. It can now be bought-for a slightly more reasonable price than T. magnatum. "

Exterior smooth to very minutely roughened but not warted; whitish when very young but soon becoming uniformly pale brown to dingy yellow-brown (about the color of an oak gall), then eventually developing dark reddish-brown to dark brown areas (or darkening overall) as it reaches full maturity. INTERIOR solid, very firm and crisp, flaking or chipping like wax, marbled; white when young, the fertile tissue becoming light brown and then dark brown with age and the meandering sterile veins remaining whitish. Odor at maturity slight, difficult to describe. SPORES (30) 34-58 x 28-50 (56) microns, broadly elliptical to round, brown and alveolate (pitted-reticulate) at maturity, with few to many pits. Asci 1-4 (6)-spored, imbedded randomly in tissue between veins. HABITAT Widely scattered to-gregarious in soil under oak and other hardwoods; known only from the west coast, fruiting mainly in the spring and early summer (at least in our area). I have found more than sixty specimens growing together in loose soil, associated with tanoak or possibly madrone, in June and July. EDIBILITY Edible. It is mild or slightly nutty like Boletus edulis, but much crisper. Slice it thinly and saute very briefly (about one minute) or the flavor will be lost. "

Asci 14 (6)-spored, imbedded randomly in flesh between veins. HABITAT Solitary to gregarious in or on soil (but under humus) in woods and at their edges; common (for a truffle) in California and oregon, also reported from Idaho and Ohio. In our area it is sometimes abundant under oak in the late winter and spring, but I have also collected it on numerous occasions under Douglas-firas lateasJ uly. The fruiting bodies are often attacked by slugs, nematodes, and fly larvae. EDIBILITY Edible. Some people detect a bitter taste, but the specimens I sampled had a very strong mushroomy flavor that would go well in sauces or gravies. "

"Genus: Elaphomyces
Species: muricatus
Common_Name: Marbled Deer Truffle
Group?: Yes
FRUITING_BODY underground, 2-5 cm broad, round to oval or somewhat lobed, very firm. Exterior yellow-brown to ochre-brown and covered with minute, hard, pointed warts that give it a pimpled appearance, but the warts usually obscured by a crust of soil and tiny rootlets (mycorrhizae) that is easily stripped or brushed away. Peridium (skin) thick (2-5 mm), hard and rindlike, marbled when sectioned (dark brown to purplish-brown with whitish to vinaceous-tinged veins). INTERIOR at first hollow, soon stuffed with cottony white hyphae, then darkening to grayish, lilac, or purplish and divided into chambers by sterile bands, finally become brownish-black to black and uniformly powdery. Odor not very distinctive. SPORES 18-30 x microns, round, warted or warted-spiny, dark brown to black under the microscope. Asci round to pear-shaped or irregular, mostly 8-spored, not forming a palisade (hymenium) and disintegrating soon after the spores form (and before they are completely mature). HABITAT Solitary to gregarious in soil or duff in woods; widely distributed and fairly common (if you're digging for truffles). It is said to prefer pine woods, but in our area I have found it as early as October under knobcone pine and manzanita and as late as July under tan oak and madrone.

Common_Name: Common Deer Truffle
Group?: Yes
FRUITING_BODY underground, 2-5 cm broad, round to somewhat oval, very firm. Exterior usually covered with small hard warts (but these often hidden by a crust of soil, yellowish mycelium, andlor mycorrhizal rootlets); sometimes pallid when young but usually pale to dingy ochraceous or yellow-brown. Peridium(skin) rindlike, very firm and thick (2-5 mm), showing a very thin yellowish outer layer (when sectioned) and a thick white to grayish inner layer that may feature darker (brown) zones, but not marbled. INTERIOR at first hollow, soon stuffed with cottony tissue, eventually becoming powdery when spores mature; white at first, soon grayish to purplish (and often separated into chambers by whitish bands), finally becoming blackish and powdery. Odor not very distinctive. SPORES 24-45 (65) microns, round, thick-walled, blackish-brown to very dark reddish-brown under the microscope, ornamented with short spines or warts. Asci mostly 8-spored, round to pear-shaped, not forming a hymenium, disintegrating before the spores are fully mature. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious in soil or humus under conifers or less commonly hardwoods; widely distributed and very common, but seldom seen by the average mushroom hunter because it grows underground. It is usually found 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) below the surface, often imbedded in or resting on clay soil at the point where it meets the humus layer. In many regions it is parasitized by species of Cordyceps-which serve as an above-ground indicator of its presence-but I have yet to observe this in our area. It fruits throughout the mushroom season and can sometimes be gathered by the bushel. I have found it under hemlock and pine in northern California, and Herb Saylor reports prolific fruitings from Mendocino County. Alexander Smith calls it ""perhaps the most common hypogeous [underground] fungus in North America""-and he should know, since he has collected so many of them! EDIBILITY Edible according to some reports, but not choice. In Europe it has been used for centuries as an aphrodesiac and truffle-substitute. "

Both stalk and head lined with long brown sterile cells (setae). Asci 8-spored. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, gregarious, or tufted in humus, moss, or soil (or occa-sionally on rotten wood), usually in woods; very widely distributed and common. It is the most abundant earth tongue in our area, sometimes carpeting large tracts of humus with its little black clubs. In seems to favor habitats shunned by other mushrooms (e.g., red-wood), and usually fruits in the winter or spring. Like other black fungi, it is difficult to see.

"Genus: Cordyceps
Species: militaris
Common_Name: Caterpillar Fungus
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY arising from buried moth and butterfly larvae or pupae, 2-8 cm tall, cylindrical to spindle-or club-shaped (i.e., with a slightly swollen upper fertile region, but lacking a well-defined ""head""); often with a longitudinal furrow. Upper (fertile) portion of club 2-6 mm broad, orange to orange-buff to orange-red, finely roughened or pimpled by the slightly protruding perithecia(flasklike nests of asci). STALK (sterile lower region) smooth, usually paler, often curved or wavy. SPORES threadlike and multiseptate, smooth, hyaline (colorless) under the microscope, breaking up into one-celled, barrel-shaped segments averaging 2-6 x 1-1.5 microns. HABITAT Solitary to gregarious or clustered on buried pupae or less commonly larvae (caterpillars) of moths and butterflies; widely distributed. It is one of the more common species in the genus, but is rare in California. In eastern North America I have found it several times in-the summer and fall. EDIBILITY Unknown. "
"Genus: Hypomyces
Species: chrysospermum
Common_Name: Bolete Eater
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY beginning as a white moldy-looking growth that attacks and quickly engulfs boletes, then turns bright yellow and powdery, then finally becomes reddish-brown (but this last stage rarely seen) and becomes pimpled. Flesh of the host often soft or mushy. SPORES in white stage 10-30 x 5-12 microns, elliptical, smooth; in yellow stage, 10-25 microns, round, thick-walled, and warted; in final (sexual) stage, 25-30x 5-6 microns, spindle-shaped, hyaline (colorless) under the microscope and usually I-septate (partitioned). Perithecia only present in final stage. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious on boletes; widely distributed and very common in our area whenever boletes are out; also reported on Paxillus and Rhizopogon. EDIBILITY Not edible, possibly poisonous. It is often associated with bacterial decay. "
"Genus: Hypomyces
Species: lactifluorum
Common_Name: Lobster Mushroom
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY growing on and engulfing gilled mushrooms {species of Russula and Lactarius) in a layer of roughened or pimpled, bright orange to orange-red to purple-red or occasionally yellow-orange tissue which is firm to the touch. Overall shape of the host mushroom and parasite often like an inverted pyramid. Flesh (of the host) crisp, white. SPORES 30-50 x 4.5-8 microns, spindle-shaped or shaped like caraway seeds, hyaline (colorless) under the microscope, septate (with one partition), warted. Perithecia im-bedded in the tissue that covers the host, but protruding as small pimples. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or gregarious in woods, often partially buried in the duff, usually on the fruiting bodies of Lactarius and Russula (especially the large white species like R. brevipes); widely distributed. It is common in some regions, but rare in our area. The largest fruitings I've seen were under ponderosa pine in the Southwest. EDIBILITY Rated highly by many people and sold in markets in Mexico. There is no absolute assurance that the host species is edible, but I can find no mention of poisonings by this species. Perhaps it only attacks edible species! Material I sampled was fairly good. "
"Genus: Xylaria
Species: hypoxylon
Common_Name: Candlesnuff Fungus
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 2-8 cm high, very tough, erect, slender, cylindrical or narrowly club-like when young but usually becoming antlerlike(branched sparsely or forked at the tip) in age. Upper portion or tip (or occasionally entire surface) white and powdery when young, eventually becoming black and minutely roughened (use hand lens!). Flesh very tough, white or pallid. STALK (lower sterile portion of fruiting body) thin, usually 1-3 (5) mm thick, black, minutely hairy, very tough or wiry. SPORES (sexual) 10-14 x 4-6 microns, bean-shaped, smooth, black in mass but brown under the microscope; asexual spores (conidia) smooth and elliptical or elongated, white in mass but hyaline (colorless) under the microscope. Perithecia imbedded in the upper part offully mature fruiting body. HABITAT Scattered to densely gregarious or clustered on rotting logs, stumps, buried sticks, etc.; very widely distributed and common. In our area it occurs year-round in many habitats, but especially on oak and tanoak in the fall and winter. EDIBILITY Much too tough to be of value. "
"Genus: Xylaria
Species: polymorpha
Common_Name: Dead Man's Fingers
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY 2-8 cm tall, 0.5-3 cm thick, very tough and hard or carbonaceous; erect, club-or finger-shaped to somewhat irregular or twisted, the tip usually blunt or rounded and occasionally lobed. Outer surface hard and crustlike, usually wrinkled, roughened, andlor cracked, black when mature but often covered with a whitish to grayish or brownish powder when very young. Flesh (interior) hard or corky, white or pallid. STALK present as a short sterile base, usually well-defined and narrower than fertile part; black. SPORES (sexual) 20-32 x 5-10 (12) microns, spindle-shaped, smooth, dark brown to black; asexual spores (conidia) when present smaller, elongated or elliptical, smooth, hyaline under the microscope. Perithecia imbedded in upper portion of fruiting body. HABITAT In groups or clusters on hardwood stumps, logs, etc., but often appearing terrestrial if the wood is buried; widely distributed and common, but apparently absent or very rare in our area. In eastern North America, where it favors beech and maple, the fruiting bodies usually appear in the spring and mature (blacken) by the summer. They last for months without decaying. EDIBILITY Much too tough and rough to be edible. "
"Genus: Daldinia
Species: grandis
Common_Name: Crampballs; Carbon Balls; King Alfreds Cakes
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY very tough and woody or charcoal-like, 1-6 cm broad or sometimes larger, hemispherical to nearly round to somewhat lumpy or irregular, stalkless. Exterior black (or sometimes dark brown when young), roughened or pimpled by the perithecia, often cracked in age. Flesh (interior) brown to grayish-black, somewhat lustrous, with lighter and darker concentric zones; very brittle and charcoal-like. STALK absent. SPORES (sexual) 14-17 (27) x 6.5-11 microns, elliptical or elongated, smooth, dark brown to black; asexual spores (conidia) minute, smooth, and hyaline (colorless) when present. HABITAT Scattered to gregarious or in masses on dead logs, branches, or bark of hard-woods; widely distributed. It is abundant year-round in our area, especially on oak. EDIBILITY Unequivocally inedible-but perhaps useful as a substitute for charcoal! "
