Common_Name: Violet Hedgehog
Group?: No
CAP 4-18 cm broad, convex to plane or centrally depressed; surface dry, at first smooth but usually cracking to form scales in age; violet-black to bluish-black, black, or raisin-colored; margin often somewhat paler or purpler and wavy. Flesh thick, firm but brittle, deep slate-purple or violet; odorand taste mild to somewhat farinaceous or cinnamon-like. SPINES deep violet to deep bluish-violet to deep lavender, the tips usually paler or lilac; soft, brittle, 2-6 (15) mm long, usually decurrent. STALK 2-10 cm long, 1-2 (3.5) cm thick, equal or more often tapered below, central or off-center, firm, colored more or less likethe spines (deep purplish). SPORE_PRINT brown; spores 5-7 x 4.5-6.5 microns, broadly elliptical to nearly round, prominently warted. HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious on ground in woods; locally common but erratic in its fruiting behavior-absent some years and abundant others; known onlyfrom western North America. In our area it fruits in the fall and winter under tanoak and madrone at higher elevations in the coastal mountains; in the Pacific Northwest, however, it favors conifers, especially hemlock and pine. It is yet another example of a conifer-lover that crosses over to tanoak-madrone (others include Armillaria ponderosa, Cantharellus subalbidus, Hygrophorus chrysodon, and Tricholoma aurantium). EDIBILITY Not recommended. Although not exactly bitter-tasting, small pieces which I sampled caused a peculiar burning sensation in the back of my throat. It would be interesting to see what color it yields as a dye. "

When older it can be mistaken for various other brownish to reddish Hydnellums. H. zonatum (=H. scrobiculatum var. zonatum, H. concrescens-COLOR PLATE 157) is a closely related, similarly colored species with a smooth or radially cor-rugated (but not lumpy) cap that is usually zoned concentrically (at least somewhat). It is quite common under hardwoods in eastern North America but also occurs on the west coast both in its normal form and a diminutive one whose cap is 4 cm broad or less. Both H. zona turn and H. scrobiculaturn are quite distinct in their typical forms, but appear to intergrade. Other similar species: H. subsuccosum resembles H. zona turn. but is more irregular in shape and juicier when fresh, and exudes a pinkish to reddish juice when squeezed; it also has yellowish-gray to yellow-green mycelium at the base of the stem and its cap is often flecked with yellowish spots or particles.H. cumulatum has many caps built on top of one another, and little or no stalk.

FRUITING_BODY typically with two to four large primary branches arising from a common base (stalk), and many smaller secondary branches arising from the primary ones; 6-18 cm high and 5-12 cm broad. BRANCHES smooth, mostly erect, olive-gray to olive-umber to smoky-yellow, grayish-tan, or yellow-brown, the basal (primary) branches dark olive-brown with a violet tinge when fresh; tips olive-yellow to dingy buff. STALK large, fleshy, white below, upper portion colored like the branches and usually tinged violet when fresh. Flesh white, firm but brittle; taste often bitterish. SPORE_PRINT pale ochraceous; spores 8.5-12 x 3.5-5 microns, elliptical, roughened. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups in humus under both hard woodsand conifers; widely distributed. In our area it is usually associated, like other fleshy Ramarias, with tanoak. It is not normally a common species, but occasionally fruits in great abundance in the fall and early winter. EDIBILITY Unknown; the bitterish taste (when present) is a deterrent. "

Common_Name: Violet Coral Mushroom
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY typically with two to four large primary branches arising from a common base (stalk), and many smaller secondary branches arising from the primary ones; 5-12 cm high and 8-12 cm broad. BRANCHES smooth, violet or lilac, slowly discoloring dingy yellowish-brown or smoky-yellow in old age; tips also violet. STALK distinct as a white fleshy base or ""trunk"" below the main branches. Flesh white, firm; taste slightly bitter or acrid. SPORE_PRINT pale ochraceous; spores 8.5-11 x 3-4 microns, elliptical, roughened. HABITAT Solitary or in small groups on ground in woods; widely distributed, but apparently very rare in California. I have found it only once in our area, near Boulder Creek, under tanoak and Douglas-fir, in December. EDIBILITY Unknown. "
"Genus: Ramaria
Species: rasilispora
Common_Name: Yellow Coral Mushroom
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY abundantly branched from a fleshy base or stalk, 540 cm high and broad. BRANCHES smooth, mostly erect, creamy to pale yellow (var. scatesiana) or yellow to yellow-orange or pale orange (var. rasilispora), but the lower branches often whitish when very young and branches in both varieties often pale or dull orange to ochraceous in old age; tips yellow or same color as branches, sometimes brownish in age. STALK fleshy, tapering to a point or rooting; white or whitish. Flesh brittle or fibrous, often with watery areas, white; taste mild. SPORE_PRINT pale orange-yellow or ochraceous; spores 8-12 x 3-4.5 microns, cylindrical, smooth or slightly roughened. HABITAT Solitary to scattered or in groups or rings on ground in woods; common in the West and probably more widely distributed. In Our area it fruits in the fall and winter under tanoak or less commonly live oak, but in other regions it is common under conifers, especially fir. In mountain ranges such as the Sierra Nevada it usually fruits in the spring and early summer, as does R. magnipes (see comments), which is common from the Siski-you Mountains northward under hemlock, fir, and other conifers. EDIBILITY Edible and quite popular, but difficult to clean and sometimes lacking in flavor. Coral fungus connoisseur Herb Saylor says it's good raw in salads or candied like grapefruit rinds. Some people, however, are adversely affected by it, and R. magnipes (see comments) is sometimes bitter when cooked. "

Species: sanguinea
Common_Name: Bleeding Coral Mushroom
Group?: Yes
FRUITING_BODY profusely branched from a fleshy base or""stalk"";4-25 cmormore high and broad. BRANCHES smooth, mostly erect; pale or clear yellow, the ti ps usually slightly brighter yellow; lower (primary) branches turning dark red or vinaceous to reddish-or vinaceous-brown when bruised. STALK fleshy, tapered below, often very short; white or whitish, typically staining dark red or wine-red to vinaceous-brown when bruised or already with such stains. Flesh white or yellowish, rather brittle; taste mild. SPORE_PRINT pale ochraceous; spores 8.5-12 x 3.5-4 microns, oblong or elongated-elliptical, roughened or smooth. HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups on ground under both hardwoods and coni-fers; widely distributed. In our area this species ""complex"" fruits in the late fall and winter under tanoak. but is not as numerous as R. rasilispora. In the Pacific Northwest and northern California several similar species (see comments) are common under conifers in the fall, and I have also seen large fruitings near Lake Tahoe in October. EDIBILITY Presumably consumable; I haven't tried it. "
"Genus: Ramaria
Species: formosa
Common_Name: Pinkish Coral Mushroom
Group?: Yes
FRUITING_BODY profusely branched from a fleshy base (stalk); 5-20 cm high and wide. BRANCHES smooth or grooved, mostly erect; pinkish to pinkish-stained orange, salmon, pinkish-tan, or even reddish, fading to pinkish-buff, tan, or dingy ochraceous in age; tips yellow or colored like branches when fresh, also fading. STALK fleshy, usually tapering downward; white at base, otherwise colored like branches (or paler). Flesh brittle to fibrous, whitish or becoming pinkish to orange in age, not gelatinous; taste usually mild but often astringent or bitter when cooked. SPORE_PRINT pale ochraceous; spores 9-12.5 x 3.5-6 microns, elliptical, minutely roughened. HABITAT Solitary, widely scattered, or in groups or rings on ground in woods, widely distributed. In the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains it is one of the most common Ramarias, fruiting mainly under conifers, but also hardwoods. In our area it favors tanoak (like just about every other fleshy Ramaria) and is fairly common in the fall and winter. EDIBILITY Said to have cathartic effects on some (or many) individuals. Until the identity of our variety (or varieties) is definitely established, it is best left alone. "
"Genus: Ramaria
Species: gelatinosa
Common_Name: Gelatinous Coral Mushroom
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY profusely branched from a fleshy base or ""stalk""; 5-15 cm high and wide. BRANCHES mostly smooth and erect, orange to pinkish-stained orange to orange-buff, pinkish-brown, or occasionally yellow-orange, sometimes developing a faint purple-gray tinge in age. STALK or main trunk whitish, rather tough. Flesh colored like branches or paler and showing translucent, often gelatinous pockets or streaks when stalk is sectioned lengthwise; taste often bitter. SPORE_PRINT pale ochraceous; spores 7-10 x 4.5-6 microns, elliptical, roughened (warted). HABITAT Widely scattered to gregarious in duff under conifers (hemlock, fir, etc.); common in the fall in the Pacific Northwest and northern California, but more widely distributed. I have yet to find it south of San Francisco. EDIBILITY Poisonous to some people (causing diarrhea and digestive upset); apparently edible for others, but hardly worth the risk. "
"Genus: Ramaria
Species: araiospora
Common_Name: Red Coral Mushroom
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY profusely branched from a fleshy base (stalk); 4-13 cm high, 3-10 cm broad or more. BRANCHES smooth. brilliant coral-red to red, crimson, or even magenta, but often fading to coral-pink, light red, orange, or even paler in old age; tips red to yellowish, fading slightly in age. STALK usually rather short, white or whitish (or dis-colored) at base, colored like branches (or paler) above. Flesh brittle; taste mild or slightly krautlike. SPORE_PRINT pale ochraceous; spores 8-13 x 3-5 microns, elliptical to cylindrical, roughened. Flesh in base of stalk not amyloid. HABITAT Solitary, widely scattered, or in small groups on ground in woods; known only from the west coast. I find it every year in the fall and winter under tanoak, but it is not as common in our area as some of the other fleshy Ramarias. Farther north it fre-quently occurs with hemlock and other conifers. EDIBILITY Presumably edible, but not as fleshy as R. botrytis and R. rasilispora. Be sure not to confuse faded specimens with the R.formosa group! "
"Genus: Ramaria
Species: botrytis
Common_Name: Pink-Tipped Coral Mushroom
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY profusely branched from a fleshy base or stalk; sometimes massive, 7-20 cm high and 6-30 cm broad or more when mature; usually very compact when young, but less so in age. BRANCHES often crowded, white or pallid when young, gradually becoming buff to dull ochraceous or tan in age; tips typically short, clefted, blunt, pink to purple, vinaceous, or red when fresh (but orange to brownish-orange in var. aurantiiramosa), fading in age. STALK thick (1.5-6 cm), fleshy, the base often rounded and swollen at or above ground level; white or whitish when fresh, tan to ochraceousin old age. Flesh firm, solid, white; taste mild in some forms, somewhat bitter in others. SPORE_PRINT pale ochraceous to ochre-buff; spores 11-16 (20) x 4-6 microns, oblong-elliptical to nearly cylindrical, longitudinally lined (striate). HABITAT Solitary, scattered, or in groups or rings on ground in woods, often partially buried in the humus; very widely distributed. Along with R. strasseri (see comments) it is common in the Pacific Northwest and Sierra Nevada under conifers in the summer, fall, and spring (but is less common in the spring than R. rubripermanens-see comments). In our area it favors tanoak and other hardwoods and fruits in the fall and winter. EDIBILITY Edible and choice, according to some. However, it has laxative effects on some individuals and bitter look-alikes (see comments) occur. It is one of the largest and fleshiest of all the Ramarias, so it is definitely worth trying. "
"Genus: Sparassis
Species: crispa
Common_Name: Cauliflower Mushroom
Group?: No
FRUITING_BODY a compactly branched mass of flattened, leafy lobes arising from a tough, rooting base or ""stalk""; 12-60 cm or more high and broad. BRANCHES (lobes) flattened, thin, usually leafy in appearance; wavy, crisped, or crimped, pliant; surfaces of lobes smooth, whitish to creamy or yellowish, often becoming cinnamon-buff or tan in age or dry weather, sometimes with darker brown stains on the edges. STALK 5-13 cm long,2-5 cm thick, usually tapered downward, fleshy but very tough, buried deep in ground (or wood). Flesh firm, white, fairly tough or elastic; odor spicy-fragrant. SPORE_PRINT white; spores 5-7 x 3-5 microns, broadly elliptical, smooth. HABITAT Parasitic on the roots of conifers, usually growing solitary at or near the bases of trunks or stumps; found in the coniferous forests of western North America. It is not uncommon in our coastal pine forests, fruiting in the same spot year after year (or sometimes twice a year), usually in the late fall or winter. It also grows on Douglas-fir and other members of the pine family. It produces a brown or yellow carbonizing rot in its host, and is economically significant in some regions. The best place to look for it is in older forests where there are plenty of mature trees. S. spathulata (see below) can grow on hardwoods. EDIBILITY Edible and exceptional. The perfect mushroom for a special occasion, it is as elegant as it looks intelligent. Thorough cooking is necessary, however, to render it tender, and it is a royal pain-in-the-posterior to clean! Gentle sauteeing or parboiling followed by baking or stewing is best. Fresh specimens can be stored for a week or two in a cool dry place, but be sure to check first for maggots! "
